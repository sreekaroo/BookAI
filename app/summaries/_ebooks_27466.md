# El Kab: A Chronological Summary of Archaeological Excavations

**1. The Genesis of the El Kab Excavation Project:** The El Kab excavation, undertaken in 1897, was initiated by Mr. Somers Clarke, who, along with Mr. J.J. Tylor, contributed significantly to its funding.  Their interest stemmed from a desire to explore the smaller, less-documented tombs at the site and investigate the large area enclosed by the town walls.  The project also benefited from a substantial contribution by Mr. Jesse Howarth, highlighting the collaborative nature of the endeavor. The team's comfortable residence in a rock-tomb further underscores the practical and pleasant conditions of their work compared to other Egyptian sites.  


**2. The Enigmatic Town Walls and Initial Observations:** The dominant feature of El Kab is its imposing town wall, enclosing a vast area.  The team immediately encountered a puzzle:  the majority of the interior showed little evidence of habitation, contrasting with the significant presence of early pottery fragments on a few elevated areas within the walls.  The team notes, “The greater part of the enclosure had never been inhabited, at least by people living in houses and using pottery. What, then, could have been the purpose of the huge walls?” This question drives much of the subsequent investigation. The walls' strategic location overlooking the valley and nearby monuments further fuels speculation about their function.


**3. Unearthing the Earliest Tombs (Mastabas and Stairway Tombs):**  The earliest tombs discovered were categorized into mastabas (with square shafts or sloping stairways), burials within large earthenware pots called _maj[=u]rs_, and contracted burials associated with what the excavators initially referred to as the "New Race."  The mastabas, often featuring recessed panels, contained a consistent grouping of artifacts, including alabaster vessels, diorite bowls, and model tools.  The name of Sneferu, a pharaoh, was found inscribed on several diorite bowls, suggesting a potential date for many of these tombs within his reign or the immediately following period.  A total of thirteen “stairway” tombs and thirty-seven mastabas were examined.


**4. The Significance of the Ka-mena Mastaba:** The Ka-mena mastaba stands out as particularly significant.  Its boundary wall and recessed panels demonstrate a level of sophistication.  Inside, while the chambers were mostly empty, the excavation yielded a collection of objects including a model granary, alabaster jars and table, a porphyry bowl, and a translucent diorite bowl inscribed with the Ka name of Sneferu, “Neb Maat.” Model tools were also discovered, analyzed by Dr. Gladstone as primarily copper with minimal traces of other elements. The inclusion of green paint on a limestone fragment further links it to the Naqada tombs, which similarly employed this decorative technique.


**5. The Nefer-shem-em Mastaba and Other Early Finds:** The mastaba of Nefer-shem-em contained two statues, one in sandstone and one in limestone, bearing the same inscription: "_Suten rekh se hez neter hon Nefer-shem-em_,"  a title suggesting his priestly role and connection to the king.  Further excavation of this mastaba uncovered a later layer of burials, possibly indicating re-use of the tomb. The discovery of a small black cylinder in another mastaba, with an engraved figure in a huge wig, added to the intriguing artifacts from this era, suggesting an even earlier date than initially suspected.


**6. Refining the Chronology: The "New Race" and its Dating:** The excavators grapple with the dating of the “New Race” remains (referred to in other texts as Libyan, Neolithic, etc.), initially placed in the VII-X Dynasty. The discovery of similar artifacts alongside Old Kingdom remains at El Kab led to a reassessment.  This reassessment is driven by factors including the prevalence of handmade pottery, the presence of green paint, and the absence of Egyptian objects in the early tombs. These findings point to a much earlier praedynastic date for most of the "New Race" civilization, supported by discoveries at Abydos and Naqada.


**7. The Middle Kingdom Cemetery:** Outside the town walls, a distinct XIIth dynasty cemetery was discovered, characterized by tombs with underground brick arches and unique pottery and stone vase shapes.  The team notes the presence of tombs with similar pottery both inside and outside the town walls, leading to questions about the age of the wall itself. A stela mentioning Amenemhat III's restoration of walls built by Usertesen II is brought up as a possible corroboration of an early XIIth Dynasty date for the town wall. The complete absence of mummification in these tombs is noted as a surprising element.


**8. Detailed Examination of Middle Kingdom Tombs:** The Middle Kingdom tombs featured long shafts leading to chambers at both ends. The tombs frequently held multiple bodies, without mummification, and the regular presence of pottery, alabaster kohl pots, and bronze mirrors is observed.  The instability of the ground repeatedly caused roof collapses, making excavation particularly challenging and leading to frequent damage to the artifacts. The limited inscription and the prevalence of specific types of pottery and beadwork are highlighted as key features. The finding of a plain alabaster statuette, possibly the earliest dated ushabti, is noted.


**9. Sparse New Empire Remains and Amenhotep III's Temple:** Compared to earlier periods, the New Empire left few traces at El Kab.  The team investigated the small, well-preserved temple of Amenhotep III, focusing on its original location, speculating that the original temple may have been located at a place now washed away by the river.  The abundance of Old Kingdom pottery near the temple supports the idea of an earlier shrine at the location. The analysis of foundation deposits from the temple, including bronze models, glazed figures, and pottery, offered further chronological clues, with inscriptions linking some finds to Amenhotep II.


**10. Foundation Deposits and the Date of the Walls:** The team's investigation into the town walls' date focused on analyzing foundation deposits and gateway structures. However, while some pottery suggests a possibly earlier date for the wall, there was conflicting architectural evidence suggesting a later date. An examination of the east gate revealed a layer of potsherds with late demotic writing, indicating later disturbance. The ambiguous evidence leaves the precise date of the massive wall unresolved.


**11. Later Finds and Concluding Remarks:**  The discovery of a large group of late bronzes, primarily Osiris figures, and a peculiar brick structure interpreted as a possible pigeon-house from a potentially earlier period than initially suspected, added to the complexity of the site. The team’s careful cataloging of the pottery and other artifacts, presented with detailed descriptions and drawings in the accompanying plates, serves as the cornerstone of this significant archaeological study. The text concludes by acknowledging assistance received from collaborators and friends during the excavation and post-excavation phases of the project.
