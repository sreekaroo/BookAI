# The Arts and Crafts of Older Spain: A Chronological Summary

Here's a chronological summary of the provided text, exceeding 10% of its original length, divided into detailed paragraphs:


**1. Ancient Legends and Roman Exploitation:**

The book opens with a discussion of ancient legends surrounding Spain's abundance of precious metals.  Authors like Strabo and Pliny described fantastical tales of rivers flowing with gold and silver, and utensils crafted from the abundant silver of the Turdetani.  While hyperbolic, these legends highlight a historical reality: Spain possessed significant mineral wealth.  The Romans exploited these resources extensively, with figures like Helvius and Cato returning to Rome with massive quantities of gold and silver.  The text emphasizes the importance of cautiously considering traditions, even those seemingly fantastical, as a starting point for historical inquiry ("Tradition...should be allowed to have its full value").


**2. Roman and Visigothic Influence on Metalwork:**

The Roman conquest led to the introduction of Roman styles and techniques in Spanish gold and silver work.  Roman jewelry, including rings (_annulus_), brooches (_fibula_), and necklaces (_torques_), became common.  The text describes a Roman silver dish discovered at Otañez with the inscription "SALVS VMERITANA," illustrating the Roman integration into Spanish society and craftsmanship.  Following the Romans, the Visigoths continued these traditions while incorporating Byzantine influences. Saint Isidore's _Etymologies_ provides insights into Visigothic jewelry, though archeological evidence remains limited until the discovery of the Guarrazar treasure.


**3. The Guarrazar Treasure: Visigothic Crowns and Crosses:**

The discovery of the Guarrazar treasure in 1858 revolutionized understanding of Visigothic metalwork.  This collection, composed primarily of gold crowns and crosses adorned with precious stones, is discussed in detail.  The crowns, described as having hinged semicircles and intricate decorations of floral motifs and red enamel, were likely votive offerings rather than solely for personal use. The inscriptions on some crosses (e.g., "[cross] RECCESVINTHVS REX OFFERET" and "[cross] OFFERET MVNVSCVLVM SCO STEFANO THEODOSIVS ABBA") offer valuable historical context and highlight the religious importance of the treasure.  A key debate revolves around whether the crowns were actually worn or solely ceremonial.


**4. Visigothic Artistic Merit and Royal Treasure:**

The author critiques the over-exaggerated praise of Visigothic metalwork by some archaeologists, noting its "coarse though costly splendour" and "imitative and decadent art" nature. The focus on precious materials over refined craftsmanship is emphasized.  Examples of royal extravagance are provided, such as Sisenand's 500-pound gold plate, illustrating the Visigothic preference for the intrinsic value of materials over artistic skill.


**5. Moorish Conquest and the Legend of Solomon's Table:**

The Moorish conquest brought with it legends of immense plundered treasure.  The text focuses on the legend of Solomon's table, a highly prized piece of Visigothic or Byzantine workmanship supposedly containing a large emerald, which became a subject of conflict between Tarik and Muza, highlighting the political and symbolic importance of treasure.  The varying descriptions of the table in different chronicles offer insight into the evolution of the legend and the value placed on such objects.


**6. Moorish and Morisco Metalwork:**

The text emphasizes the often-overlooked importance of Moorish and Morisco metalwork in Spain. Despite Islamic prohibitions on ostentatious displays of wealth, Moorish rulers and their subjects frequently employed precious metals and stones in their art and architecture. The Alhambra's silver columns, described by Al-Jattib, are an example of this.  The text also highlights the intricate jewelry worn by Moorish women, often featuring geometrical and filigree designs, providing evidence of the continuation of Moorish traditions in the Morisco community after the Reconquista.  The Expulsion of the Moriscos resulted in a significant loss of this artistic heritage.


**7. Christian Metalwork from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance:**

The book details the rich tradition of Christian metalwork following the Reconquista, focusing on items like chalices and reliquaries. Examples such as the chalice of Santo Domingo de Silos, and the ornate crosses of Oviedo Cathedral (the Cross of Angels and the Cross of Victory, with their inscriptions emphasizing their votive nature), illustrate the blend of Visigothic, Moorish, and Byzantine influences.  The text discusses the importance of votive offerings and the gradual evolution of reliquaries from simple containers to elaborate chests and triptychs.


**8.  The Golden Age of Custodias and the Work of Juan de Arfe:**

The fifteenth century is identified as the "age of the _custodia_," with massive silver monstrances becoming increasingly elaborate. The work of Juan de Arfe, a renowned silversmith, is highlighted, emphasizing his classical style and the intricate details of his creations. The text describes his _custodia_ of Seville Cathedral, reflecting his classical ideals and mastery of both artistic design and technical skill.  The author emphasizes Arfe's versatility and learning, citing his book _De Varia Conmensuración_ which covered geometry, anatomy, and architecture, alongside his metalwork.


**9.  Seventeenth-Century Extravagance and the Decline of Craftsmanship:**

Despite Spain's decline in the seventeenth century, extravagant displays of wealth continued among the aristocracy and church. The text recounts descriptions of lavish clothing, banquets, and court festivities, highlighting the continued demand for precious metalwork.  However, the author notes a decline in craftsmanship, with a preference for showy filigree work over more artistic forms and a growing dependence on foreign artisans.  Sumptury laws are cited, attempting to control the excessive use of gold and silver.


**10. Ironwork: Keys, Knockers, and Rejas:**

The chapter on ironwork begins with the symbolic importance of keys, citing the famous Moorish and Christian keys of Seville Cathedral. The text then explores decorative ironwork, including door knockers, nails with ornamented heads, and, most importantly, the magnificent _rejas_ (grilles) found in churches and palaces throughout Spain.  The evolution of _rejas_ from simple security features to complex works of art is discussed, emphasizing the technical skill involved and referencing prominent _rejero_ (grille-makers) like Juan Francés and Cristóbal de Andino.  The author notes the limited historical information available concerning individual craftsmen and their techniques.


**11. Balconies, Pulpits, and other Ironwork:**

The text examines other types of Spanish ironwork, focusing on balconies and window gratings, whose intricate designs and abundance contributed to the unique character of Spanish streets, and church pulpits (e.g., Avila Cathedral), which showcases both the practical and decorative potential of the medium. The author highlights the integration of architectural features into ironwork design. The regulations of the Granada locksmiths' guild are cited, showing both the value of the craft and concerns about the craftsmen’s dishonesty.


**12. Bronzes: From Roman Lamps to Moorish Fountains:**

The chapter on bronzes starts with a survey of early bronze artifacts, primarily weapons, then moves to Roman lamps and lampstands. These lamps, with their characteristic shape and functionality, are shown to have influenced later Spanish lamp designs.   Moorish bronzes are discussed, including the scarce surviving examples, with Al-Makkari's descriptions of the Alhambra's fountains and bronze animals being a key source.  The author highlights the magnificent bronze lamp of Mohammed the Third of Granada, combining Moorish and Christian elements, and its uncertain provenance.


**13. Spanish Bronze Crosses and Other Artifacts:**

The discussion of bronzes continues with a focus on religious objects, such as processional crosses. The text highlights the scarcity of surviving early medieval bronze crosses and mentions specific examples, such as the bronze crucifix from the monastery of Arbós.  The  _Puertas del Perdón_ (Gates of Forgiveness) of Seville and Cordova Cathedrals are mentioned as examples of bronze doors combining Moorish and Christian craftsmanship.  The artistic accomplishments of Bartolomé Morel are highlighted with his work in Seville Cathedral—tenebrarium and the Giralda weathercock.


**14.  Arms and Armor: From Prehistory to the Renaissance:**

The book delves into the rich history of Spanish arms and armor, starting with prehistoric stone and bronze weapons.  The text moves to Roman and Visigothic weaponry, and discusses the development of the Spanish sword, its influence on Roman weaponry, and its unique features over the centuries, providing detail on regional variations in weaponry and fighting styles among the ancient Iberian tribes.

The author highlights the importance of both practical functionality and lavish decoration in the armor of the aristocracy.


**16. Moorish and Morisco Weapons:**

The chapter delves into the weapons of the Spanish Moors, describing their equipment and highlighting the significant role of Toledo and other cities as centers of arms production.  Specific examples of surviving Moorish swords and daggers (like Boabdil's sword and dagger) are described, highlighting their elaborate decoration and inscriptions, indicating the importance placed on both religious and artistic elements in their craftsmanship. The author notes the influence of Moorish sword designs on later Christian weapons.


**17. The Royal Armory of Madrid and Notable Spanish Swords:**

The Royal Armory of Madrid is discussed as a key repository of Spanish arms, albeit one emphasizing royal and foreign items over a truly representative collection.  The author highlights the beautiful and artistically significant examples of Spanish swords, discussing notable examples and their attribution, including arms associated with Ferdinand and Isabella, Gonzalo de Córdoba, and Francisco Pizarro.  The author cautions against dubious attributions and stresses the importance of critical evaluation of sources.


**18.  Toledo Swords and the Decline of the Craft:**

The text focuses on the renowned Toledo sword-making tradition, discussing both the technical aspects of blade-making and the legendary skill of Toledo smiths, citing contemporary accounts describing techniques and using quotes from Bowles regarding the importance of materials and water in the tempering process. The author discusses both the zenith and decline of this tradition, linking it to changes in fashion and the increasing import of foreign arms.  The resurgence of sword making in Toledo in the late 18th century is also mentioned.
