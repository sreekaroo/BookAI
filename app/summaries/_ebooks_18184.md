# Animal Carvings from Mounds of the Mississippi Valley: A Summary

This summary provides a detailed chronological breakdown of the book "Animal Carvings from Mounds of the Mississippi Valley" by Henry W. Henshaw, exceeding 10% of the original text length.

## 1. Introduction: Questioning Mound-Builder Supremacy

Henshaw opens by acknowledging the prevailing belief among some archaeologists that the Mound Builders possessed superior artistic skills compared to contemporary Native American Indians. He introduces the concept of Mound Builders as a convenient term for the people who built the mounds in the Mississippi Valley, explicitly stating he does not subscribe to the theory that they were a separate race from Native Americans.  He focuses his study on the animal carvings found on pipes, emphasizing the importance of accurately identifying these carvings to avoid misinterpretations of their cultural significance.

## 2. The Pipe as a Central Artifact

The text highlights pipes as significant artifacts, both for their prevalence and the sophisticated sculptural skill demonstrated in their creation.  Henshaw notes the commonality of animal and bird depictions on these pipes, a tendency mirrored in the art of contemporary Native American groups.  He anticipates that careful zoological analysis will be needed to correctly identify the carved animals, which will then allow for a better understanding of the interpretations of archaeologists.

## 3. Methodology: A Naturalist's Perspective

Henshaw clarifies his methodology, approaching the analysis of carvings from a naturalist's perspective, treating them as though they were zoological illustrations.  He acknowledges the potential limitations of applying such high standards to artifacts from a semi-civilized culture.  However, he justifies this approach by arguing that the prevailing theories regarding the carvings' significance rely on the assumption of their accuracy as naturalistic representations.  He aims to investigate whether this assumption is valid.

## 4. The Misidentification of Manatees

Henshaw launches into a critical examination of the "lamantin, manitus, or sea cow" carvings, initially identified as manatees by Squier and Davis in their influential work, "Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley." He challenges their identification by pointing out inconsistencies.  He quotes Squier and Davis' assertion that the carvings "faithfully represent animals and birds peculiar to other latitudes," highlighting how this interpretation became a cornerstone for theories about Mound Builder origins. Henshaw shows that several carvings initially identified as manatees were actually otters, illustrating with figures from both Squier and Davis and Stevens. He emphasizes that manatees lack external ears, a feature present in all the disputed carvings.


## 5.  Otters vs. Manatees: A Detailed Comparison

The analysis progresses to a detailed comparison of otter and manatee anatomy. Henshaw notes that even though several carvings resemble otters more than manatees, the authorsâ€™ interpretations were inconsistent. He uses figures to show the clear discrepancies between the carvings and actual manatees, highlighting the presence of ears and inappropriate feet in the carvings. He refutes the suggestion that the differences in tail shape represented different manatee species, stating that both species have similar tails.  He includes figures from Murie's work to illustrate the accurate features of manatees.  Henshaw concludes that the carvings are otters, not manatees.


## 6. The Cincinnati Tablet Enigma

The discussion turns to the Cincinnati Tablet, specifically focusing on the discrepancies between Squier and Davis' representation and Short's later rendering of the back of the tablet.  Squier and Davis describe formless depressions, possibly from tool sharpening, while Short depicts a shape vaguely reminiscent of a manatee. Henshaw notes the lack of consensus on the tablet's authenticity, and concludes that its ambiguity doesn't provide reliable evidence.

## 7. The Problematic Toucan Carvings

Henshaw analyzes the supposed toucan carvings. He critiques Squier and Davis' inconsistent identification of three distinct carvings as toucans, showing that one carving is actually a crow, and another a wading bird likely an ibis.  He points out that Stevens' illustration of one carving modifies the original to appear more toucan-like.  Henshaw contrasts these carvings with an accurate depiction of a keel-billed toucan, revealing their stark differences. He notes the acceptance of these carvings as toucans by some, but their rejection by others who emphasized lack of clear evidence.

## 8.  The Misidentified Paroquet

The paroquet carving is examined, and Henshaw conclusively demonstrates that the carving actually depicts a hawk, highlighting features like the bill and cere that clearly distinguish it from a paroquet.  While acknowledging that paroquets once had a wider northern range, including parts of the mound region, Henshaw concludes there's no clear artistic evidence from the mounds themselves to confirm Mound Builder familiarity with this bird.

## 9.  The Wider Range of "Exotic" Animals

Henshaw criticizes Wilson's assertion of Mound Builder familiarity with a variety of animals purportedly not found in the United States.  He refutes this claim one by one, providing evidence that jaguars, cougars, buzzards, and even the paroquet had ranges that extended into the United States, particularly the Mississippi Valley, at the time.  He also points out Wilson's misconception regarding the range of the _Pyrula perversa_ conch shell.


## 10. Further Errors in Identification and Artistic Skill

Henshaw proceeds to examine additional carvings, highlighting further inaccuracies in Squier and Davis' identifications.  He challenges the assertions of extraordinary skill in the carvings, arguing that the carvings accurately depicting animals often rely on easily recognizable features rather than detailed anatomical accuracy.  He includes examples of misidentified owls, grouse, turkey buzzards, and snakes, demonstrating that only a minority of carvings are correctly identified. He quotes Dr. Coues' opinion that many carvings may not be intended as specific species but rather general representations.

## 11. The Nature of Mound Builder Artistic Skill

Henshaw examines the degree of skill evident in the carvings. He argues that the most praised carvings are those that feature easily identifiable features. He claims the ability of the Mound Builders to create accurate representations of animals was overestimated, and that many carvings are simplistic attempts without specific animals in mind. He contrasts this interpretation with the exaggerated praise given by Squier and Davis and others. He notes that many carvings contain inconsistencies and peculiarities not found in real animals, supporting the idea that the artists may not have intended specific realism.

## 12. Totemic Interpretations and Animal Mounds

Henshaw suggests that the animal carvings may have had totemic origins, pointing out the prevalence of totemism among North American Indian tribes and the frequent use of animals depicted in the carvings as totems. He proposes this theory as an alternative to purely decorative or artistic interpretations, suggesting that their ornamental aspects might be secondary to their totemic significance. The discussion extends to the animal mounds, arguing that few, if any, exhibit sufficient detail for specific identification. He notes the "Elephant Mound" and other animal mounds as examples of vague resemblance, suggesting totemic interpretations are more appropriate than highly detailed naturalistic ones.

## 13. The Elephant Mound and Mastodon Pipes

The analysis focuses on the "Elephant Mound" in Wisconsin, examining the claims that it depicts a mastodon and therefore supports the theory of Mound Builder coexistence with this extinct animal.  Henshaw argues that the resemblance is weak, lacking essential mastodon features like tusks and tail. He points out that only one such mound has been discovered, questioning why more mastodon depictions wouldn't exist.  The discussion then considers the "elephant pipes" from Iowa, noting inconsistencies with mastodon anatomy. He emphasizes the questionable circumstances surrounding their discovery, suggesting a lack of reliable evidence for the coexistence theory.

## 14. Alligator Mound and Human Sculptures

The text briefly addresses the "alligator mound," acknowledging its vague resemblance to any number of long-tailed animals, not just alligators.  Finally, Henshaw addresses human sculptures, challenging the belief that they represent accurate portraits of individuals or specific racial types. He argues that variations in the sculptures reflect a lack of artistic skill rather than a diverse population. He contends that the arguments for accurate portrayal rely on the supposed accuracy of the animal carvings, an assertion already refuted.


## 15.  Comparison of Mound Builder and Indian Art

Henshaw then compares the art of Mound Builders with that of various Native American tribes. He notes the tendency of some tribes towards conventionalized and grotesque representations, but cautions against overemphasizing this difference as a marker of distinct races. He suggests that this stylistic difference represents stages of artistic development rather than inherent racial differences. He points out that even highly conventionalized Native American art often retains underlying realistic representations.

## 16. Conclusion: Re-evaluating the Evidence

Henshaw concludes by summarizing his main points: there is no evidence of carvings depicting non-native animals, invalidating theories about Mound Builder migration; the carvings lack specific details, rendering many identifications unreliable; the human sculptures are similarly lacking in precision; and the artistic skill of the Mound Builders has been overstated.  He underscores the need for caution in interpreting archaeological artifacts and the limitations of using art style as the sole basis for sweeping conclusions about origins and cultural development.
