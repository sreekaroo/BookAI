# The Arts and Crafts of Older Spain: Volume 2 - A Summary

## Prehistoric and Roman Influences (Missing Pieces)

The book begins by acknowledging the lack of surviving furniture from prehistoric, Roman, or Visigothic Spain.  While accounts from ancient authors suggest the use of folding chairs and wall benches, no physical evidence exists. However, the author points to Roman Spain's adoption of Roman social and artistic life, evidenced by gold, silver, and pottery finds. This suggests the presence of common Roman furniture items like *lectus triclinaris* (eating couches), *lectus genialis* (state beds), *lectus cubicularis* (sleeping beds), chairs (*cathedra*, *bisellium*, *solium*, *scabellum*, *sella*), and benches (*subsellia*).  Saint Isidore's writings further support this cultural assimilation.  The text also highlights the continuity of fireplaces and braziers from Roman times to the present.

## Medieval Furniture: A European Style (The Imposing Bed)

Early medieval Spanish furniture, like that of the rest of Christian Europe, is described as "rude magnificence," initially following Roman and Byzantine styles, with Visigothic influence. Viollet-le-Duc's detailed descriptions of these are referenced. The dominant piece was the large bed, elaborately adorned with canopies and hangings, initially constructed from iron or bronze before evolving to carved wood in the 14th century. The text provides a detailed inventory of the bed of Princess Juana (1392), showcasing the opulent textiles (velvet, silk), metalwork, and elaborate embroidery, highlighting the sheer volume of material and accessories associated with the bed. The dining table, which also served as a writing surface, and the sideboard laden with precious items also feature prominently.

## Medieval Seating and Storage (The Bride's Chest)

The medieval Spanish home included a variety of chairs and stools around the fireplace, with household members often sitting on floor carpets. The lord's armchair was notably ornate, evolving to have a tall Gothic back. Chairs for guests had moderate heights, and loose fabric coverings were common until the 16th century, when upholstery techniques improved.  A key element of the household, shared by both Moors and Christians, was the *caja de novia* (bride's chest) or *arcón* (large chest), ranging in size and material from small caskets to massive storage containers.  These chests served numerous purposes, and their decorative richness varied depending on the intended use and time period.

## The Arcón: Diverse Functions and Decoration (From Burial to Baggage)

The author discusses various types of *arcones*, from burial chests (examples include those of Doña Urraca and San Isidro) to those for storing church artifacts, documents, treasure, arms, and grains (*arcones-trojes*).  The famous "coffer of the Cid" at Burgos, though likely not the original, illustrates a form designed for transport.  The text contrasts the plain iron-clad chests of early medieval times with the later, more ornate *arcones* displaying Gothic and Renaissance carvings, with Mudejar influences often lingering. The evolution of *arcón* designs mirrors the broader shifts in Spanish art and culture.

## Moorish Influence on Furniture (A Scarcity of Objects)

Moorish furniture was sparse, prioritizing rich carpets, wall hangings (leatherwork and colored leather), intricate carvings on doors, ceilings, and *celosías* (lattices), and decorative vases over substantial wooden pieces.  The author quotes Lancelot Addison's descriptions of Moorish homes in 17th century Morocco, illustrating the importance of cleanliness, the use of cushions as seating, and the absence of utensils like napkins, knives, and spoons – reflecting a simpler, more practical approach to furnishing than in contemporary European culture.  The limited furniture present was often symbolic of rank.

## Moorish and Christian Seating (The Importance of Cushions)

The Moorish throne is examined, noting that early forms were simple wooden seats that later became lavishly decorated.  The text connects this to the Christian Spanish use of cushions as a sign of honor, raising the seated individual above the rest. This is linked to the depiction of cushions in the Alhambra's Hall of Justice painting. The continued use of cushions for women's seating in Christian Spain, even until the 18th century, is noted, highlighting the cultural impact of the Moorish aesthetic.  The act of "giving a chair" (*dar silla*) or "taking the cushion" maintained its significance as a social gesture.

## Renaissance Furniture and Sumptuary Laws (Increased Luxury and Restrictions)

The Renaissance saw increased luxury in the furniture of Spanish royalty and nobility.  An inventory of Doña Juana's estate (1574) mentions a silver bed balustrade, highlighting the use of precious metals. Another inventory from 1560 for the Dukes of Alburquerque details a wide array of textiles, carpets, and furniture, demonstrating the opulence of the period. However, the text notes the counterpoint of sumptuary laws aiming to restrict the excessive use of precious materials in furniture production, showing the tension between artistic expression and social control.

## Leatherwork: Guadamacilería (From Barbary to Europe)

The art of decorating leather (*guadamacilería*) is traced to a possible African origin, with the term *guadamecí* possibly linked to Ghadames in Barbary.  Cordoba was the main center of this craft in Spain, with Seville, Lerida, Barcelona, and Valladolid also known for producing high-quality *guadamecís*.  The text details the preparation and decoration techniques, including stamping, engraving, the application of gold and silver leaf (introduced in the 16th century), and the use of colors like red, green, blue, black, white, and carmine. The author provides details about contracts and regulations concerning *guadamacilería* from Cordova's Ordinances, illuminating the industry's structure and challenges.

## Wood Carving and Mudejar Style (Ceilings, Doors, and Celosías)

Spanish artistic carpentry focuses on *celosías* (window lattices), *lazo*-work doors, and *artesonado* ceilings – styles of decoration influenced by eastern traditions and adapted to the Spanish climate, just as in Cairo.  The text quotes Lane-Poole's work on Cairo woodwork, emphasizing the influence of climate on paneling techniques to prevent warping and cracking in the sun.  The author notes the high status of carpentry in Spain and contrasts the apparently crude execution with the sophisticated aesthetic results, visible when viewed from a distance. The book explores the different types of *lazo* work in ceilings, providing specific examples of surviving masterpieces in various locations.

## Sacred Statuary, Choir Stalls, and Retablos (Wood as a Dominant Material)

Spanish wood-carving excels in religious statuary, choir stalls (*sillerías*), and altarpieces (*retablos*). The author discusses the prevalence of wood, highlighting the Spanish preference for polychrome painted wood even in comparison to bronze and marble.  The text names prominent wood carvers (*imagineros*) like Alonso Cano, Martínez Montañes, and Juan de Juni, detailing their styles and famous works.  The evolution of choir stalls is discussed, tracing the initial German and Flemish influence and the subsequent development of a unique Spanish style.  The text provides numerous examples of impressive *sillerías* in cathedrals across Spain, detailing their styles, materials, and iconography.  The text also describes the *retablos*, emphasizing the German influence on these altarpieces, and the magnificent example of Seville Cathedral's retablo is described in considerable detail.

## Glassmaking: From Roman Times to the 19th Century (Imitation Gems and Royal Factories)

The book examines glassmaking, noting early Celtic artifacts and the Roman influence which utilized special clays from Valencia or Tortosa.  Saint Isidore's writings confirm the Visigothic knowledge of glassmaking and the creation of coloured glass imitating gemstones. The text mentions the *latticinio* style and its continuity to modern Spanish glass. The author discusses  treatise *El Lapidario* which describes glass-making techniques, including colorants and the use of diamonds for cutting glass.  The text details the decline of Moorish glassmaking in Almería, contrasting with the continued production and export of high-quality glass from Barcelona.   The establishment and eventual decline of several royal glass factories in the 18th and 19th centuries in locations like Cadalso, San Ildefonso (La Granja), and Nuevo Baztán, are examined, demonstrating both Spanish innovation and the challenges of competing with foreign manufacturers.

##  Catalan Glass and Pottery (A Flourishing Industry)

Catalan glassmaking flourished from the 13th century, producing glassware rivaling Venice.  The guild of Barcelona glassmakers is examined, noting its establishment and the export of glass to Rome.  The text further highlights the production of coloured glass for religious structures, noting the contributions of German, French, and Flemish artisans and the evolution of techniques from mosaic-like styles to larger, painted panels.   The chapter also details the production of common household glassware, mentioning vessels like the *porrón*, which may have distant Persian origins.  The text contrasts the high quality of Catalan glass with the often-glassless windows of Spanish houses in the 17th and 18th centuries. The use of different clays and techniques in the making of pottery is also explored, with a comparison of different styles and regions.

##  Pottery: A Diverse History (From Ancient Times to the Buen Retiro)

The book examines the history of Spanish pottery in great detail, from prehistoric sun-dried wares, through Roman and Visigothic pottery, to Hispano-Moresque and later styles.  The wide range of pottery found in different regions and periods is illustrated.  The text explores Hispano-Moresque pottery, emphasizing the evolution of techniques, including lustred ware from the 12th century onward.   Different types of tiles and the *cuerda seca* process are discussed, providing details on the materials, techniques, and artistic styles.  The book further details the importance of Seville in tilemaking and mentions several important artists, emphasizing the combination of Moorish and Christian influences, particularly in the work of Niculoso Pisano.  The author addresses various pottery centers, such as Talavera de la Reina, and their notable styles and techniques. The text also describes the royal porcelain factories of Alcora and Buen Retiro, detailing the technological advances and artistic styles produced under royal patronage, including details about imported expertise and the challenges of maintaining these industries in Spain.  The author concludes with a discussion of the decline of certain types of pottery and glassmaking by the 19th century.
