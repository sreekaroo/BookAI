## Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Confessions: A Chronological Summary

### Early Life and Education in Geneva (1712-1725)

Jean-Jacques Rousseau was born in Geneva in 1712, the son of Isaac Rousseau and Suzanne Bernard.  His mother died shortly after his birth, leaving a profound impact on his father, who instilled in young Jean-Jacques a love of reading and a republican spirit.  Their evenings were spent reading romances, sparking an early sensitivity to emotions: "An infinity of sensations were familiar to me, without possessing any precise idea of the objects to which they related--I had conceived nothing--I had felt the whole."  Later, he developed a passion for Plutarch's Lives, fostering his republican ideals and a strong aversion to oppression.  His father's exile to avoid imprisonment after a quarrel with a powerful man, marked a significant turning point:  "My father had a quarrel with M. G----...This G----, who was an insolent, ungenerous man... preferred a voluntary banishment for the remainder of his life."  This event sent Rousseau to Bossey to board with the Lamberciers, where he cultivated a deep friendship with his cousin Bernard: "Our studies, amusements, and tasks, were the same; we were alone; each wanted a playmate; to separate would in some measure, have been to annihilate us." This idyllic period, however, ended with a harsh punishment for a crime he did not commit, leaving lasting psychological scars: "The first instance of violence and oppression is so deeply engraved on my soul."


### Apprenticeship and Escape (1725-1728)

Rousseau's education continued with a less favorable apprenticeship to an engraver, where the brutality and constraints of his master drove him to vices he previously abhorred: "The vilest inclinations, the basest actions, succeeded my amiable amusements."  He developed a habit of stealing, not from greed, but from a lack of access to the things he desired: "Desire and inability united naturally led to this vice."  His burgeoning love for reading led him to neglect his work, further exacerbating his troubled relationship with his master. His theft of asparagus, driven by a desire to please a fellow apprentice, and subsequent independent thefts, highlight his moral conflict.  The incident with the apples, vividly recounted, captures his youthful recklessness and impulsive nature: "The dragon did not sleep; the pantry door opens, my master makes his appearance..." Ultimately, his flight from Geneva at age sixteen marked his resolute rejection of his oppressive circumstances: "I swore never to return to my master's, and the next morning...I bade them an eternal adieu."


### Conversion to Catholicism and Turin (1728-1729)

Rousseau's journey to Annecy and his encounter with Madame de Warens were pivotal.  He found not a devout old woman, but a charming and alluring convert: "Instead of which, I see a face beaming with charms, fine blue eyes full of sweetness..." Madame de Warens' beauty and engaging manner immediately captivated him.  His subsequent journey to Turin, under the auspices of a Savoyard priest and Madame de Warens, exposes his naivete and vulnerability.  He was admitted to a hospital for catechumens, exposed to a harsh environment and morally questionable companions.  His conversion to Catholicism, undertaken more out of circumstance and a desire for sustenance than genuine conviction, marks a turning point in his religious journey. He recounts the humiliating ceremonies involved and the profound sense of betrayal he felt afterward: "I was made both a dupe and an apostate."


### Madam de Vercellis and the First Crime (1729-1730)

In Turin, Rousseau's attempts to find employment prove unsuccessful, leading to a brief but significant relationship with Madam Basile, a tradeswoman: "Her good-nature, the compassionate tone of her voice, with her gentle and caressing manner, soon set me at ease with myself."  Their brief, chaste relationship highlighted his inherent shyness and lack of experience.  A subsequent position as a footman to the Countess de Vercellis brought him into contact with more worldly figures, yet also a profound sense of disillusionment regarding the sincerity of their concern for him.  The theft of Madam de Vercellis's ribbon and the false accusation of Marion reveal his flawed character and lack of judgment: "I was obliged, therefore, to renounce this dear antechamber; at first it caused me some uneasiness, but other things intervening, I presently thought no more of it."


### Madam de Warens and Annecy (1730-1732)

Rousseau returned to Annecy, finding solace and a renewed sense of belonging in the company of Madam de Warens. Their relationship deepened, marked by an affectionate familiarity that moved beyond the conventional mother-son dynamic: "Child was my name, Mamma was hers, and child and mamma we have ever continued." Their days were filled with mutual affection, simple pleasures, and intellectual pursuits, though marred by her financial irresponsibility and his own idleness.  Rousseau's growing passion for music led him to work with M. le Maitre, a Parisian music master, an experience of intense joy and contentment:  "This interval is one of those in which I enjoyed the greatest satisfaction, and which I have ever recollected with pleasure."


### Chambery and the Loss of Innocence (1732-1736)


Rousseau's life in Chambery is described as remarkably peaceful and simple. The arrival of M. d'Aubonne disrupted this tranquility, offering Rousseau a potential but ultimately fruitless path toward a more stable life.  M. d'Aubonne's assessment of Rousseau as "a lad of very little sense" underscores Rousseau's continued struggle with expressing his intelligence effectively.  A position assisting in a land survey provided a stable income but lacked intellectual stimulation.  The subsequent development of his relationship with Madame de Warens is described, moving into a deeper intimacy and a more complex emotional dynamic that surpasses typical mother-son affection. He details the unique and unconventional nature of their physical relationship, emphasizing its unusual context: "That which might have ruined me, acted as a preservative, at least for a time."  The death of Claude Anet, Madame de Warens' faithful servant, is a tragic event that deeply affects Rousseau, revealing the depth of his loyalty to the household and a fleeting moment of regrettable self-interest: "The generous Madam de Warens turned from me, and (without any reply) burst into tears."


###  Musical Pursuits and the Charmettes (1736-1741)

The move to Les Charmettes, a country retreat, is marked by a renewed sense of peace and happiness.  His time is divided between work, study, and the simple joys of rural life.  However, his precarious health continues to cause concern.  His fondness for music intensifies and dominates his pursuits, while his interactions with various individuals, including M. le Maitre, and the notable Father Cato, illustrate the social complexities of this period.  The intense, albeit ultimately platonic, relationship with Mademoiselle de Breil is recounted, highlighting Rousseau's inherent shyness and romantic ideals: "What would I not have given to hear her command..."


### Besançon, Turin, and the Decision for Paris (1741-1742)


Rousseau’s attempts to further his musical studies in Besançon are cut short by the loss of his belongings at a border crossing, highlighting the absurdity of his situation.  The incident with his confiscated portmanteau containing a Jansenist parody is particularly telling of his continued vulnerability to unforeseen consequences of his actions.  A failed attempt to establish himself in Turin leads him to embrace his musical talent and seek his fortunes in Paris, representing a key turning point that moves him away from the quiet countryside life toward a potentially more challenging but ultimately destructive environment.  He acknowledges the challenges of navigating Parisian social circles, his own inherent shyness and the superficiality of his initial attempts to make a name for himself:  "How much did Paris disappoint the idea I had formed of it!"


### Parisian Life and the Rise of Rousseau (1742-1750)

Rousseau's initial experiences in Paris are marked by a struggle for financial stability and social acceptance. He recounts his attempts to promote his musical notation system to the Academy of Sciences, facing rejection based on misunderstanding and preconceived notions.  He describes his encounters with notable figures like the Duke de Richelieu, and the challenging yet ultimately rewarding relationship with his long-term companion Thérèse Levasseur. He recounts the births of his children and his decision to place them in the foundling hospital, an action he would later deeply regret.  The composition of his opera “Les Muses Galantes” and the pivotal essay “Discourse on the Arts and Sciences,” commissioned by the Dijon Academy, represent significant artistic and intellectual achievements that would forever shape his reputation.


###  The Hermitage, Montmorency and the Beginning of the End (1750-1762)


The move to the Hermitage, provided by Madame d'Épinay, offers a period of relative tranquility, interrupted by ongoing health problems and increasing financial anxieties.  Rousseau details the composition of his opera “Le Devin du Village” and its unexpected success at court. This is contrasted by the deepening rift between him and his erstwhile friends Diderot and Grimm. He details his complicated relationships with the women in his life, including his deep respect for Madame de Warens and a complex, ultimately platonic, passion for Madame d'Houdetot.  The growing tensions with Madame d'Épinay are chronicled through letters that expose his conflicted loyalties and the beginning of his downfall.  The composition of "Julie, or the New Heloise" is documented, revealing the powerful impact of his experiences on his writing.


###  The Downfall of Rousseau:  Geneva, Motiers, and Exile (1762-1765)

The publication of Rousseau's works, particularly "Émile, or On Education," leads to widespread condemnation and persecution.  He is driven from Geneva, Berne, and ultimately Motiers.  His encounters with various individuals throughout Switzerland further reveal the complexities of his relationships and the growing hostility directed toward him.  He details his attempts to find peace and support amidst the escalating controversy, the hostility from both religious and intellectual circles, and the complexities of his relationships with Madame d'Épinay, Madame d'Houdetot, and Saint Lambert.  The composition of "The Social Contract" is also documented, further illustrating his intellectual endeavors amidst turmoil.


###  The Flight to England and Beyond (1765-1778)


The final chapter depicts Rousseau's flight to England with David Hume, his escalating paranoia, and his eventual return to France. The breakdown of his relationship with Hume underscores his increasingly unstable mental state.  He concludes with a reflection on his life, his regrets, and the inescapable nature of his fate. The text ends with Rousseau anticipating his death, expressing a hope for a peaceful end and acknowledging his life's complexities and the unwavering pursuit of truth that defined his being.
