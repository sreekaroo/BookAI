# What is Art?: A Summary of Leo Tolstoy's Treatise

This summary condenses Leo Tolstoy's *What is Art?* into chronological paragraphs, highlighting key arguments and examples.

## I. The Enormous Cost and Human Toll of Art

Tolstoy opens by highlighting the immense resources—financial and human—devoted to art.  He describes the enormous buildings, the labor of countless workers, and the sacrifices of artists themselves, whose lives are often dedicated to mastering specialized skills at the expense of broader human experiences. A vivid example is his depiction of an opera rehearsal, filled with the director's anger and the demoralization of the performers, whose repetitive, artificial work seems pointless and devoid of real meaning.  This sets the stage for his central question: is art truly worth such a cost?


## II. The Question of Art's Worth and the Confusion of Definitions

Tolstoy questions whether art compensates for its considerable expense and human cost. He points out the lack of consensus regarding the definition of art itself.  He challenges the common understanding that art simply “produces beauty,” noting that this definition is insufficient and inconsistently applied. The word “beauty” itself is problematic; Tolstoy contrasts its straightforward aesthetic meaning in Russian with its expanded, moral connotation in other European languages. This ambiguity highlights the lack of a clear, universally accepted definition of art.


## III. A Survey of Conflicting Aesthetic Theories

Tolstoy meticulously reviews numerous aesthetic theories, from Baumgarten’s early work defining beauty as sensory perception of the perfect to the later, more subjective and physiological accounts of beauty as disinterested pleasure. He analyzes Kant’s distinction between subjective and objective perceptions of beauty, and highlights the contradictions and ambiguities within various German and French aesthetic schools (Hegel, Schopenhauer, Schelling, etc.).  He notes the frequent merging of the concepts of beauty, goodness, and truth, indicating the fundamental issues with defining art solely through the lens of beauty.


## IV. The Insufficiency of Beauty-Based Definitions and the Need for a New Criterion

Tolstoy concludes that existing definitions of art, based on beauty or pleasure, are fundamentally flawed and insufficient. He finds these definitions either vague (mystical definitions), too broad (including activities like cooking), or too narrow (excluding works that don't produce immediate pleasure).  He emphasizes the need for a clear definition that allows for the objective identification of works of art, independent of personal taste.


## V. Tolstoy's Definition of Art: The Transmission of Feeling

Tolstoy proposes his own definition:  “Art is a human activity, consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings, and also experience them.”  He emphasizes that art is a means of communication, transmitting feelings rather than thoughts.  The success of art is measured by its "infectiousness"—the degree to which it unites the artist and the audience in shared feeling.  This establishes an internal, subjective criterion for judging art, though Tolstoy acknowledges that this criterion may be obscured by societal conditioning.


## VI. The Rise of Exclusive Art and its Perversion

Tolstoy explains the historical shift from art as primarily religious expression to art as a source of pleasure for the wealthy elite.  This shift, he argues, was caused by the upper classes losing faith in Church Christianity without adopting true Christian principles of brotherhood and equality. They replaced faith with a pursuit of personal enjoyment, creating an “exclusive art” that served only their needs and tastes. This lack of a unifying religious belief led to inconsistencies and a weakening of art itself.


## VII. The Characteristics of Counterfeit Art

Tolstoy identifies four main methods employed to produce counterfeit art: (1) borrowing (using established "poetical" subjects and elements), (2) imitating (reproducing realistic details), (3) striking effects (using contrasts, novelty, and sensory stimulation), and (4) interestingness (capturing attention through complex plots or puzzles).  He argues that these methods may entertain or provoke, but they don't transmit the genuine emotion that characterizes true art. The example of Wagner's opera is used as a prime example of this counterfeit art.


## VIII. The Role of Professionalism, Criticism, and Art Schools in the Corruption of Art

Tolstoy critiques professionalism, art criticism, and art schools as contributing factors to the decline of art. Professionalism, he claims, often diminishes sincerity, while criticism, lacking an internal standard, relies on tradition and thus perpetuates outdated or flawed artistic judgments. Art schools, focused on teaching technique rather than genuine feeling, produce imitators rather than original artists. He argues these institutions foster an "hypocrisy of art" which replaces sincerity and genuine feeling.


## IX. The Incomprehensibility of Modern "High Art" and the Capacity of the Common People

Tolstoy discusses the growing incomprehensibility of modern art, particularly among the "Decadents," such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, using examples of their deliberately obscure poetry and prose to illustrate this point. He contrasts this with the accessibility of great works of art from the past—the *Iliad*, the Gospel parables, folk songs—which were and are still understood and appreciated by ordinary people. This points to a fundamental failure of the current art to fulfill art’s true purpose.  He argues that the incomprehensibility to the common person is evidence that this is not true art.


## X.  Tolstoy's Conclusion: The Art of the Future and the Importance of Religious Perception

Tolstoy concludes that the art of the future will be radically different from contemporary art. It will be guided by a true Christian understanding of brotherhood and love, focusing on conveying feelings that promote human unity. He calls for simplicity and clarity of expression, rejecting the artificial complexity of much modern art.  He believes this new art will be accessible to all people, not just a privileged few, and that it will serve not as mere entertainment but as a powerful instrument for moral and spiritual transformation, thus fulfilling its true purpose within human life. He links the future of art to a similar reformation within science, arguing that both must be guided by a genuine understanding of life's purpose,  drawing upon a genuine Christian understanding of human brotherhood and love for a more just society.
