# Franklin's Way to Wealth: A Summary

Here's a chronological summary of Benjamin Franklin's "The Way to Wealth," exceeding 10% of the original text length, broken down into detailed paragraphs:

**1. The Auction and Father Abraham's Introduction:**

The narrative begins at an auction where people lament the difficult economic times.  A respected elder, Father Abraham, is called upon for advice regarding the burden of heavy taxes. He offers concise counsel, echoing Poor Richard's adage, "For a word to the wise is enough," setting the stage for a sermon on fiscal responsibility and self-improvement.  He immediately shifts the focus from government taxes to self-imposed burdens.

**2. The Tax of Idleness:**

Father Abraham's first point tackles the pervasive problem of idleness. He equates idleness with a heavy tax, asserting that it "shortens life" by leading to disease.  He reinforces this with Poor Richard's wisdom: "Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labour wears, while the used key is always bright." The importance of time management is emphasized with another quote, "But, dost thou love life? then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of."  The excessive time spent sleeping is criticized; "the sleeping fox catches no poultry, and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave."

**3. The Importance of Diligence and Industry:**

Building on the condemnation of idleness, Father Abraham champions diligence and industry as antidotes to poverty. He highlights the virtues of early rising and consistent work with the famous saying, "Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise." He uses vivid imagery to depict the contrast between the slothful and the industrious, claiming that laziness is so slow that "poverty soon overtakes him."  He emphasizes the importance of self-direction, stating, "Drive thy business; let not that drive thee."  A trade or calling is presented as a source of both wealth and honor.  Finally he illustrates the power of persistence, referencing "Constant dropping wears away stones; and by diligence and patience the mouse ate in two the cable; and little strokes fell great oaks."

**4. Leisure and its Acquisition:**

Addressing concerns about the lack of leisure time, Father Abraham clarifies that true leisure is earned through diligent work. Poor Richard's wisdom is again cited: "Employ thy time well, if thou meanest to gain leisure; and, since thou art not sure of a minute, throw not away an hour."  A crucial distinction is drawn between "a life of leisure and a life of laziness," emphasizing that idleness does not equate to leisure.

**5. The Necessity of Personal Oversight:**

Shifting focus from sheer industry, Father Abraham stresses the importance of careful management and self-reliance. He cautions against over-dependence on others, warning that "Trusting too much to others' care is the ruin of many."  Several Poor Richard proverbs emphasize this point:  "I never saw an oft-removed tree, Nor yet an oft-removed family, That throve so well as those that settled be," and "The eye of the master will do more work than both his hands."  The adage "Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge" underscores the critical role of attention to detail and personal responsibility. A memorable anecdote about a lost rider due to a neglected horseshoe nail highlights the devastating impact of small oversights.


**6. The Virtue of Frugality:**

Father Abraham introduces frugality as a vital complement to industry. He points out that earning without saving leads to financial ruin;  "A man may, if he knows not how to save as he gets, 'keep his nose all his life to the grindstone, and die not worth a groat at last. A fat kitchen makes a lean will.'" The importance of saving is underscored by contrasting the riches of the Indies with Spain's poverty, attributed to excessive spending.  He warns against seemingly insignificant expenses, quoting, "Many a little makes a mickle," and "A small leak will sink a great ship."

**7. Avoiding Extravagance and Debt:**

Father Abraham directly addresses the allure of extravagance and the dangers of debt. He condemns the pursuit of superficial appearances, citing, "Silks and satins, scarlet and velvets, put out the kitchen fire." The pursuit of fashion is ridiculed as a path to poverty, contrasting the "genteel" reduced to borrowing from the industrious. The proverb,  "A ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees," starkly illustrates the superiority of honest work over ostentatious displays of wealth.   He stresses the dangers of borrowing: "He that goes a borrowing, goes a sorrowing."

**8. The Dangers of Pride and Debt:**

Father Abraham continues his critique of extravagance, focusing on the destructive nature of pride and debt.  He emphasizes that pride leads to contempt; "Pride that dines on vanity, sups on contempt;--Pride breakfasted with Plenty, dined with Poverty and supped with Infamy."  The folly of emulating the rich while remaining poor is likened to a frog trying to match the size of an ox. He explicitly links debt to dishonesty, claiming that "The second vice is lying, the first is running in debt." The loss of liberty incurred by debt is highlighted, asserting that a debtor surrenders control over their own life to their creditor.

**9.  The Importance of Heaven's Blessing:**

Despite emphasizing hard work and prudent financial practices, Father Abraham acknowledges the importance of divine favor. He urges listeners not to rely solely on their own efforts but to seek God's blessing humbly and to practice charity towards those less fortunate. The story of Job is used to illustrate that even with suffering, prosperity can follow.

**10. The Value of Experience and Conclusion:**

The sermon concludes with a final piece of Poor Richard's wisdom: "Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other." Father Abraham emphasizes the limitations of advice, recognizing that "We may give advice, but we cannot give conduct."  He ends with the reminder that those who reject sound counsel cannot be helped, concluding with a final proverb: "If you will not hear Reason, she will surely rap your knuckles." The story ends with the ironic observation that the auction attendees, having heard the sermon, immediately engage in the very extravagance they had been warned against.  Richard Saunders, the author, ends by resolving to continue wearing his old coat instead of buying a new one, illustrating the practical application of Father Abraham's advice.
