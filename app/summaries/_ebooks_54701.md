# Gothic Architecture: A Chronological Summary

**1. The Misnomer of "Gothic" and French Origins:** The book begins by challenging the conventional term "Gothic Architecture," arguing it's a misnomer.  The author, Édouard Corroyer, strongly asserts that this architectural style, flourishing from the mid-12th to the end of the 15th century, originated in France, specifically in Aquitaine, Anjou, and Maine, before radiating throughout Europe. The editor, Sir Walter Armstrong, acknowledges Corroyer's "thoroughly French standpoint," noting his tendency to attribute admirable Gothic features to Gallic origins, even sometimes contradicting his own cited authority, Viollet-le-Duc.  Armstrong concedes this "Chauvinistic tone" but emphasizes the book's value as a depiction of Gothic development.  He highlights Corroyer's focus on broad principles and evolution, driven by material conditions, discoveries, and social changes.  This focus, Armstrong suggests, outweighs the geographical limitations of Corroyer's largely French-centric perspective.

**2. The Pointed Arch and its Precursors:** The text addresses the common misconception that the pointed arch is the defining feature of Gothic architecture.  While acknowledging its prevalence, Corroyer points out its existence in earlier structures – 9th-century Cairo, Armenia, and even Persia.  The arch's function, he notes, is purely one of expediency, allowing for increased stability by reducing lateral thrust.  The pointed arch, far from being a rigid form, undergoes significant variations over time,  from its near-round form in the 12th century to more acute angles in the 13th and 14th, often prioritizing height over solidity.  This pragmatic approach, Corroyer argues, stands in contrast to the more classical proportions of round arches.

**3. The Aquitainian Cupola: The Genesis of the Groined Vault:** Corroyer traces the origins of Gothic architecture to the Romanesque period, highlighting the influence of the cupola.  He specifically identifies the cupola of St. Front in Périgueux as a pivotal structure, solving the problem of concentrating vault thrust on four points of support using pendentives.  This innovation, constructed in dressed stone, had significant repercussions. "The construction of such a cupola as that of St. Front in dressed stone was an event of great moment..." he writes.  Later churches, like those at Angoulême and Fontevrault, demonstrate attempts to refine this principle, reducing the mass of the cupola and refining the distribution of thrust. This, Corroyer argues, leads directly to the development of the intersecting arch and subsequently, the groined vault.

**4. The Intersecting Arch and its Refinement:** Corroyer details how the pendentives of the Aquitainian cupola evolved into independent, actively functional intersecting arches. Churches at Angers and Laval are presented as prime examples of this transition, showcasing intersecting arches supporting groined vaults in square compartments.  He contrasts the Roman ribbed vault—where ribs were primarily decorative—with the Angevin system, where intersecting arches actively carry the vault's weight.  The text emphasizes the crucial difference: "The triangular fillings no longer imprison the ribs…They now contribute to the elasticity of the divers organs of the vault."

**5. The Spread of Intersecting Vaults:** The adoption of the intersecting arch system rapidly spread. Corroyer cites numerous examples from Anjou, Maine, and beyond, such as churches in Poitiers, Mans, and even Southern France (Thor, St. Sauveur, Bordeaux, Agen). The system, he argues, proved adaptable to diverse materials and climates.  However, the author reserves his highest praise for Angers, highlighting the "grandiose architectural composition" and "admirable technical skill" in the churches of St. Maurice and Ste. Trinité.  Ste. Trinité, in particular, demonstrates a further refinement with a central transverse arch in each bay, enhancing elegance and stability.


**6. Northern Adoption and the Basilican Plan:** While initially adopted in Southern France, the intersecting arch system profoundly impacted Northern French architecture, particularly in the Ile-de-France.  Corroyer explains how Northern architects, notably those of the Ile-de-France, adapted the Angevin system to the basilican plan, constructing churches with multiple aisles (three or five).  He cites Noyon as a crucial early example, where the square-compartment vaulting, though later modified, demonstrates a crucial step toward the development of the more common rectangular bay of later Gothic cathedrals.  The influence of Angers is unmistakable, representing a logical development from the Aquitainian cupola.

**7. The Flying Buttress: A Revolutionary Innovation:** Corroyer attributes the invention of the flying buttress to the architects of the Ile-de-France.  He contrasts earlier methods of supporting barrel vaults (narrow, gloomy churches) with the new system.  Noyon, with its detached semi-arches under the side-aisle roofs, is presented as a pivotal step.  However, Soissons Cathedral provides the first clear example of the fully external, detached flying buttress ("detached semi-arches in open air").  Corroyer notes that even then, the buttresses, initially insufficient and susceptible to weather damage, posed considerable structural challenges. The reconstruction of these buttresses in 1880 underscores the precarious nature of this innovative yet ultimately imperfect system.  The text notes that the flying buttress, combined with intersecting arches, allowed for much taller and lighter structures.

**8. Cathedrals of the 12th and 13th Centuries: A Synthesis of Styles:**  This section examines several major cathedrals, illustrating the evolving integration of various architectural systems. Laon, influenced by Noyon and Soissons, utilizes both flying buttresses and sex-partite vaulting. Notre Dame de Paris, similarly, blends Norman traditions (two-storied aisles) with the influence of the dome (sex-partite vaulting).  Sens and Bourges Cathedrals further demonstrate this blend, using quadripartite and sex-partite vaulting, respectively, but still exhibiting the illogicality of equally strong flying buttresses despite varying internal thrusts.  The author notes the growing sophistication and boldness of design, but also the limitations of the purely empirical methods of the builders.

**9. The High Gothic Cathedrals: Boldness and Precariousness:** The 13th-century cathedrals of Rheims and Amiens represent high points of Gothic architecture. Rheims, while magnificent, exemplifies the dangers of the flying buttress system, requiring later reinforcement.  Amiens, even bolder than Rheims, features more daring structural elements, which pushed the limits of balance and equilibrium.  The text utilizes Beauvais Cathedral as a cautionary tale, where the pursuit of extreme height led to the collapse of the choir vault in 1284.  The chapter underscores the tension between ambitious design and the unpredictable nature of the equilibrium-based system, particularly regarding the stability of the exterior flying buttresses.  The widespread adoption of the Gothic style across Europe is also noted, with variations depending on local conditions and building materials.

**10.  Gothic Architecture in England: A Question of Influence:**  The chapter addresses the considerable influence of French Gothic architecture on English cathedrals, citing Lincoln as a prime example.  However, the editor, Sir Walter Armstrong, intervenes here, quoting Viollet-le-Duc's counter-argument that the choir of Lincoln, while undeniably Gothic, is distinctly English in its design and details.  This highlights the ongoing debate regarding the extent of French influence and the independent development of Gothic styles in different regions. The Cathedrals of York, Ely, Wells, Salisbury, and Canterbury are mentioned as evidence of the broader assimilation of French methods within an evolving English context.

**11.  The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Centuries: Decadence and Regional Variations:** The 14th and 15th centuries show a shift in Gothic architecture. Churches such as St. Ouen at Rouen illustrate a trend towards more refined but ultimately less substantial piers and an excessive use of decorative detail.  Corroyer contrasts this northern development with the more conservative approach in Southern France, where single-aisled churches with strong internal buttresses and chapels remained the norm. Albi Cathedral is highlighted as a prime example of this Southern style, characterized by its robust brick construction and fortress-like exterior.  The text further explores regional variations, including the fortified churches of the period, reflecting the social and political instability of the times.  Mont St. Michel Abbey is presented as an example of a large-scale project that spanned centuries, displaying both the late Gothic's intricate detailing and a decline in structural robustness.

**12. Towers, Steeples, Choirs, and Chapels: Architectural Details and Evolution:** The chapter discusses the development of towers and steeples, tracing their evolution from early round forms to the more common square base with octagonal spires.  The author highlights the symbolic significance of towers, not just as belfries but also as expressions of power, both ecclesiastical and civic. The text examines the transition from lantern towers to timber flèches.  Choirs and chapels are also addressed, outlining their historical development and the increased importance of apsidal chapels in later Gothic churches, reflecting the growing veneration of saints and relics. The detailed descriptions of features like the flying buttresses of Mans Cathedral and the unusual design of the choir at Lincoln highlight the evolution and regional styles.

**13. Sculpture and Painting: The Allied Arts:** Corroyer stresses the close relationship between architecture and the allied arts, especially sculpture and painting. The chapter traces the evolution of sculpture from Romanesque influences to the naturalistic style of the 13th century, exemplified by the statuary of Rheims and Amiens Cathedrals, and the move away from Byzantine conventions.  He also explores the development of ornamental sculpture, linking it to earlier traditions modified by a closer observation of nature.  The text discusses the importance of imagery, including carved wood and ivory work, highlighting the high level of craftsmanship and artistic skill evident in pieces from various ateliers.  A discussion of the decline of monumental sculpture in the 14th and 15th centuries contrasts with the continued vitality of imagery, a continuation of Gothic artistic expression, which did not decline as rapidly.

**14. Painted Decoration: Frescoes and Stained Glass:** The final chapter examines the development of painted decoration. The discovery of the frescoes in Cahors Cathedral in 1890 provides a unique glimpse into the 13th-century painting style. Corroyer describes the compositional techniques, the use of color, and the gradual shift towards naturalism. He contrasts the methods used in frescoes with stained glass, emphasizing the importance of harmony between the glass work and the architecture. The chapter discusses the evolution of stained-glass techniques, from the simple, austere styles of the 12th century to the more complex and rich compositions of later periods, including the use of yellow glass and the eventual move towards more pictorial styles in the 15th and 16th centuries.  The section concludes with a brief discussion of enamel work, noting the development of techniques and the high quality of Limoges enamels.

**15. Monastic and Civil Architecture: Completing the Picture:** The remaining sections detail monastic and civil architecture,  showing the interconnectedness of the styles and the influence of religious architecture on secular buildings.  Monastic architecture, strongly influenced by the Benedictine and Cistercian orders, is discussed, contrasting Cluny's opulence with the austerity of Citeaux.  The evolution of Carthusian monasteries and fortified abbeys are also explored.  The final section moves into civil architecture, addressing barns, hospitals, houses, and the _hôtels_ of the nobility. The text demonstrates the gradual shift from purely functional structures to buildings with distinct architectural features, influenced by the styles of the time, and the development of town-halls and belfries as symbols of civic power.  The discussion of palaces further illustrates the interconnectedness of the styles, noting that palace design often incorporated elements from all other architectural types.  The book concludes with a reiteration of the French origins and the expansive influence of this artistic style.
