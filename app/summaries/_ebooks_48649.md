# The Rosetta Stone: A Chronological Account

## Discovery and Initial Acquisition

The Rosetta Stone, a crucial artifact for deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, was discovered near Rosetta (Rashîd) in Egypt's Western Delta in August 1799.  Accounts differ on its precise location—either lying on the ground or embedded in a wall being demolished by French soldiers constructing Fort St. Julien.  A French officer of engineers, whose name is variably spelled Boussard or Bouchard, found the stone. Its significance was immediately recognized due to the presence of both Greek and unusual characters, hinting at a multilingual inscription. Bouchard reported his find to General Menou, who had it moved to his Alexandria residence, making it his personal possession for roughly two years.  Napoleon Bonaparte, upon learning of the stone, ordered its transfer to Cairo's Institut National.  The Emperor's own interest, and his commissioning of copies, highlights the immediate recognition of the stone's scholarly importance. This included the use of innovative methods: "to cover the surface of the Stone with printer’s ink, and then to lay upon it a sheet of paper which they rolled with india-rubber rollers until a good impression had been taken." These ink impressions were then sent to scholars across Europe, including France.

## The Stone's Journey to England

Following Sir Ralph Abercromby's military success in Egypt in 1801, the Treaty of Capitulation stipulated the surrender of various Egyptian antiquities to British forces, the Rosetta Stone among them (Article XVI).  While some artifacts were sent to England quickly, the Rosetta Stone's departure was delayed. After ink impressions were made, it was moved from Cairo to General Menou’s Alexandria home.  The stone's handover wasn't straightforward, since it was considered Menou's private property. Major-General Turner eventually obtained it in October 1801, transporting it aboard H.M.S. "L'Égyptienne" and reaching Portsmouth in February 1802.  The significance of this transfer highlights the shifting geopolitical landscape and the value placed on the stone by both French and British authorities.

## Initial Examination and Dissemination of Copies

On March 11, 1802, the Rosetta Stone was deposited with the Society of Antiquaries of London for a detailed examination by leading Oriental and Greek scholars. Its inscription, written in two languages (Egyptian and Greek), and two Egyptian scripts (hieroglyphic and demotic), was a significant challenge.  Early translations of the Greek text were quickly made by Weston (presented to the Society of Antiquaries), Du Theil (in France), and Ameilhon (Latin). The author mentions the early work on the Demotic text by Silvestre de Sacy and Åkerblad, with Åkerblad successfully identifying names such as Alexander, Alexandria, Ptolemy, and Isis.  The Society's President commissioned plaster casts for Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, and Dublin, and distributed engraved copies of the Greek text to major academic institutions across Europe.  This ensured broad access to the text, vital for accelerating decipherment efforts.  The Stone's move to the British Museum later that year made it accessible to the public.

## Physical Description of the Rosetta Stone

The Rosetta Stone is an irregularly shaped block of black basalt, measuring approximately 3 feet 9 inches long, 2 feet 4-1/2 inches wide, and 11 inches thick.  Significant portions, particularly at the corners, are missing. The author estimates a minimum of 12 inches of missing length based on the inscriptions. The text speculates that the original, complete stone was likely significantly taller (5-6 feet), possibly featuring a relief of the Winged Disk of Horus and royal figures, similar to other stelae from the Ptolemaic period.  This detailed description contextualizes the stone's current state, emphasizing its incomplete nature while suggesting its potential original grandeur.

##  The Languages and Scripts of the Inscription

The inscription is bilingual (Egyptian and Greek), with the Egyptian part appearing in two scripts: hieroglyphic (the older, pictorial script) and demotic (a cursive, abbreviated form of hieratic). The hieroglyphic text has 14 lines, while the demotic contains 32 (with initial imperfections). The Greek text comprises 54 lines, many with incomplete endings. The author notes that discoveries of other stelae (e.g., the 1898 Damanhûr stele) allow for the near-complete restoration of the missing portions. The text emphasizes that the Greek, hieroglyphic, and demotic are related, presenting three perspectives on the same decree.

## Early Decipherment Attempts

Reverend Stephen Weston’s initial translation of the Greek text provided a crucial foundation. Early efforts focused on the cartouches—oval shapes containing royal names—in the hieroglyphic text.  The early work of de Sacy and Åkerblad shows the early steps toward decipherment, focusing on royal names. Dr. Thomas Young's contribution was monumental, establishing the phonetic principle in hieroglyphs and successfully identifying the name of Ptolemy.  Young's work was further advanced by J. W. Bankes, who deciphered Cleopatra's name on a Philæ obelisk. The importance of Coptic (the late Egyptian language) is highlighted, as its knowledge was essential for Champollion's work.  Champollion built on Young's foundation to greatly expand the decipherment, correctly identifying the hieroglyphic forms of many Roman Emperors and developing a systematic grammar.

## Champollion's Breakthrough and the Method of Decipherment

Champollion's mastery of Coptic and comparative analysis of various cartouches is credited with his breakthrough. The text explains how the decipherment utilized the assumption that cartouches always contained royal names, leveraging the Greek text to deduce phonetic values. Comparing cartouches from the Rosetta Stone and Bankes' Philæ obelisk, and meticulously analyzing variations, Champollion established the phonetic values of numerous hieroglyphs. The method was iterative, using initial successful decipherments of names (like Ptolemy and Cleopatra) to unlock the meaning of additional signs. The detailed explanation shows how comparing different versions of cartouches was crucial.

##  The Phonetic Value of Hieroglyphs

The detailed explanation of how specific hieroglyphs were deciphered, step-by-step, is pivotal.  The process used the Greek transcriptions to assist in determining the phonetic value of glyphs within cartouches. For example, by comparing the cartouches presumed to contain the names "Ptolemy" and "Cleopatra,"  the text shows how the repeated occurrence of specific signs allowed for deducing their phonetic values (e.g., P, L, K, E, O, T, A, R). The repeated mention of the importance of Coptic highlights how the continued existence of the language was vital to the process of understanding the ancient language.  The authors describe how even royal titles ("ever-living, beloved of Ptah") were identified by connecting hieroglyphs with Coptic words and meaning.

## The Content of the Rosetta Stone Decree

The inscription on the Rosetta Stone is a decree issued by the Egyptian priesthood, commemorating the coronation of Ptolemy V Epiphanes in the ninth year of his reign (196 BC). The decree details the king's benefactions—financial gifts, tax reductions, debt forgiveness, prisoner releases, and military successes. These benefits are listed exhaustively within the text, detailing the political and social context of the decree. The detailed list of Ptolemy V's actions highlight the political and social aims of the decree.

##  The Priests' Gratitude and its Commemoration

The decree was a testament of the priests' gratitude to Ptolemy V.  It detailed measures to increase his ceremonial honors, including creating statues for temples, golden figures for processions, and designating specific days as festivals. The decree included instructions for creating copies of the decree in hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek scripts—resulting in the Rosetta Stone. The text quotes from the decree, showing how it mandated that "copies of this Decree shall be cut upon slabs of basalt in the ‘writing of the speech of the god,’ i.e. hieroglyphs, and in the writing of the books, i.e. demotic, and in the writing of the Ueienin, i.e. Greek." This directly explains the creation of the Rosetta Stone and its multilingual nature.
