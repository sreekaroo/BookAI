# Andrea Pozzo's Rules and Examples of Perspective: A Summary

This document summarizes Andrea Pozzo's "Rules and Examples of Perspective proper for Painters and Architects, etc.", a 1707 English translation of the original 1693 Roman edition.  The book uses a highly visual approach, with 105 plates illustrating Pozzo's methods.  This summary will focus on the core concepts and methodology presented.


## 1. Introduction and Dedication

The book begins with a dedication to Queen Anne, highlighting the importance of perspective in painting and architecture, fields the Queen patronized.  The translator and engraver, John Sturt, emphasizes the practical application of the art, contrasting Pozzo's clear methods with the "Difficulties and Obscurities" of previous texts. Sturt expresses hope that the book will contribute to the flourishing of the arts during Queen Anne's reign, particularly in the rebuilding of Whitehall Palace.  The preface to the translation reinforces this, stating the aim is to present a method "Wholly free from the Confusion of Occult Lines".  The Latin and Italian original versions are also mentioned.


## 2. Foundational Concepts: Plan, Horizon, Eye, and Distance

Pozzo introduces fundamental concepts through Figure I, illustrating the relationship between the geometrical plan (A), elevation (B & C), the ground line (HI), the horizontal line (NON), the point of sight (O), and the point of distance (N).  The text emphasizes that "nec fieri potest ulla optica delineatio, quin primo loco designentur duæ parallelæ, una plani seu terræ, altera horizontis," highlighting the absolute necessity of establishing these lines before commencing any perspective drawing.  The three diagrams are designed to showcase how a perspective view is created from a single viewpoint (N) relative to the plan and elevation.


## 3. Delineating Basic Shapes: Squares and Rectangles

Figures II-IV demonstrate how to project squares and rectangles into perspective. Figure II shows the construction of a single square using visual lines converging to the point of sight (O) and a line to the point of distance (E), establishing the perspective foreshortening. Pozzo recommends folding the paper for efficiency, emphasizing practical application: "Compendium temporis & laboris facies...". Figure III extends this method to rectangles, utilizing the same principles. Figure IV further develops the process, illustrating the projection of a double square through strategic paper folding to minimize effort and maintain precision.


## 4.  Multiple Squares and the Importance of Plans and Elevations

Figure V introduces the concept of multiple squares in perspective and connects plan and elevation. It illustrates how the apparent distance of each successive square from the ground line is a function of its perspective. The text emphasizes: "In omnibus his Quadratis lineas longitudinis esse partes visualium, lineas vero latitudinis esse parallelas lineæ plani," clarifying the definitions of length and breadth in this context. It further outlines the construction of multiple bases without occult lines, using only the heights and breadths of angles derived directly from the perspective plan and upright.


## 5. Perspective Construction without Occult Lines

Figure VI showcases Pozzo's primary method for constructing perspective without the need for complex "occult lines," lines used in earlier perspective methods that were often confusing. This figure directly uses heights and breadths from a separate plan and elevation to create the perspective view. The clear separation of the plan (B) and elevation (A) is emphasized, a crucial step in Pozzo's method.


## 6. Applying the Method to Architectural Elements

Figures VII-XIII demonstrate the application of Pozzo's system to various architectural components, starting with a divided base (VII), and proceeding to a stylobate (VIII), and finally extending to the five orders of classical architecture as defined by Vignola (IX-XIII).  The text explicitly mentions the goal to create "apparentias solidorum juxta regulam traditam," making the geometrical foundations crucial to creating realistic representations.  Each figure provides a step-by-step approach combining the plan and elevation to produce clean and accurate perspectives.  Figure X and XI further emphasize techniques for managing the complexities that arise when lines converge too closely within limited space.


## 7.  Rendering Circles and Cylinders in Perspective

Figures XIV-XVI address the challenge of depicting circles and curved surfaces. Figure XIV illustrates that circles are constructed by using squares, and that their perspective counterparts maintain a correspondence in terms of their constituent points. The text warns against excessive use of squares for many circles, prioritizing clarity. Figures XV and XVI apply this technique to a column and the Tuscan base, highlighting how the curved components are derived and how the heights are obtained from elevations and breadths from the plans.  Figures XVII-XX extend this application to Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Attic bases.


## 8. Depicting Capitals and Entablatures

Figures XXI-XXVII illustrate the projection of capitals and entablatures from different orders, emphasizing that the same underlying principles apply. The authors note some practical considerations, such as the location of the ground line being above the horizontal line for capitals that sit atop taller columns, emphasizing that their appearance is "sublimiora nostris oculis". The method uses geometrical elevations and plans to derive the perspective representations.


## 9. Complex Architectural Compositions

Figures XXVIII-LII demonstrate the application of Pozzo's methods to increasingly complex architectural structures.  Figures XXVIII-XXIX show the construction of a Doric building in perspective, step-by-step, highlighting the use of both plan and elevation.  Figures XXX-XXXV show the creation of a composite cornice and entablature and Figures XXXVI-XXXIX further exemplify complex compositions with columns and statues. Figures XL-XLVII showcase a Doric design, including the management of perspective complexity through multiple ground lines (XLII-XLIV). The same treatment is provided for an Ionic composition (XLVII-L).  Figures LI-LIII further elaborate on these concepts, emphasizing the use of modules for scaling and the depiction of spiral columns.


## 10.  Combining Real and Fictitious Architecture: Stage Design

Figures LXI-LXXVII focus on the practical application of perspective in creating stage sets and large architectural illusions.  Figure XXX illustrates the "jungendi fictum cum vero," the artful blending of painted and real architectural elements.  This shows how perspective can create the illusion of continuity between painted and real structures. Figures LXI-LXII detail constructing multi-layered stage sets using net-work systems and multiple frames, demonstrating the practical application of perspective principles on a large scale.  Figures LXXII-LXXVII explore the special challenges and solutions related to the construction of stage sets and other theatrical illusions, including how to deal with oblique lines inherent in stage mechanisms.


## 11. Horizontal Perspective and Vaults

Figures LXXVIII-XCII transition to horizontal perspective, focusing on ceilings and vaults.  The author points out the relative ease of horizontal perspective compared to vertical: "projectiones horizontales...expeditiores & faciliores sunt verticalibus," emphasizing that the principles remain consistent.  Figures LXXVIII-LXXXII apply horizontal perspective to corbels, pedestals, columns, and capitals. Figures LXXXIII-LXXXVI extend these concepts to complex horizontal structures such as cornices and column arrangements. Figures LXXXVII-XCII show the construction of perspective on vaulted and domed ceilings, focusing on a highly practical step-by-step method, emphasizing the use of a three-layered grid system for accurately transferring complex curves onto curved surfaces.


## 12.  The Ludovisi Church and Conclusion

Figures XCIII-C conclude with a case study of the Ludovisi Church (St. Ignatius), demonstrating the application of perspective to a complex, irregular structure. Figures XCIII-XCIX provide a detailed step-by-step explanation of designing the perspective of a complex church interior.  Figure C outlines the use of a hanging net system to create the third level of perspective grid necessary for transferring designs onto vaulted and domed ceilings. The concluding section emphasizes the importance of applying these rules consistently across all parts of the work: "regulas omnes Perspectivæ horizontalis, æquè in hominibus aut animalibus, ac in columnis aut coronicibus pingendis, omnino servari oportere," further stressing that the principles of perspective extend beyond just architecture to encompass all elements within a scene.  The inclusion of a subscriber list indicates the widespread interest in the book at the time of publication.
