# Autobiography of a Yogi: A Summary in Chronological Paragraphs

## Early Life and Spiritual Awakening

The autobiography begins with Paramahansa Yogananda's unusual early memories, including recollections of a past life as a yogi in the Himalayas and a premonition of his future.  He describes his childhood in Gorakhpur, India, with saintly parents who were disciples of Lahiri Mahasaya. His mother's profound compassion and father's logical, yet ultimately compassionate, nature shaped his early life.  The author highlights a pivotal moment where his intense prayer for Lahiri Mahasaya's presence resulted in a vision of his guru and his subsequent healing from cholera.  A childhood incident involving his sister Uma demonstrates his early awareness of the power of focused intention and the ability to manifest events through the power of will.

## Mother's Death and the Amulet

Yogananda's mother's death profoundly impacted him. A vision shortly before her passing urged him and his father to rush to Calcutta, highlighting her prescient awareness of her own death. His uncle's intervention prevents a suicidal attempt, demonstrating the family's supportive nature, even during intense grief.  Following his mother's death, Yogananda's longing for God intensified, leading to an unsuccessful attempt to run away to the Himalayas. His mother's deathbed message reveals that she had been given a silver amulet by a sage, which was to be passed to Yogananda when the time was right to begin his spiritual journey.  This amulet would mysteriously appear and eventually disappear, reflecting the cyclical nature of spiritual progress.

## Encounters with Saints and the "Perfume Saint"

Before meeting his destined guru, Yogananda encountered various saints and spiritual figures.  An anonymous sage at the Kalighat Temple teaches him profound lessons on self-analysis and overcoming inner obstacles.   A chance encounter with a "perfume saint" named Gandha Baba demonstrates the power of yogic techniques to manipulate matter and scent, though Yogananda questions the spiritual value of such displays. The "Perfume Saint" explains his technique took twelve years to master, materializing scents through the control of finer-than-atomic energies. Yogananda counters that such feats, while demonstrating God's power, lack spiritual substance.

## The Tiger Swami and Nagendra Nath Bhaduri

Yogananda recounts his meeting with the "Tiger Swami," a man of immense physical strength who had fought tigers with his bare hands. The Swami emphasizes the importance of mental strength and courage over physical prowess, highlighting the need to conquer inner "tigers" of desire and ego.  His story reveals a shift in his life from physical feats to a life of spiritual devotion.  The author then discusses his encounters with Nagendranath Bhaduri, a "levitating saint" who emphasized the importance of experience (Anubhava) over mere meditation technique.  Bhaduri’s prophecies about Yogananda’s future role in bringing yoga to the West are foreshadowed.

## The Penniless Test and Meeting Sri Yukteswar

Yogananda's brother Ananta, testing his faith, sends him and Jitendra Mazumdar to Brindaban without money. This "penniless test" highlights Yogananda's unwavering faith and God's timely intervention through various unexpected encounters.   They receive assistance from strangers, leading to a meeting with a young man who reveals himself as Yogananda's guru, Sri Yukteswar Giri. This meeting, in Benares, ends with Sri Yukteswar’s unexpected insistence that Yogananda return home temporarily, foreshadowing further tests of his dedication.

## Years of Training with Sri Yukteswar

Yogananda spends several years at Sri Yukteswar's Serampore hermitage, undergoing intense spiritual training.  Sri Yukteswar’s initial coldness soon gives way to a deep, though understated, affection. He insists on Yogananda continuing his college education, predicting his future role in bringing India's teachings to the West.  Yogananda recounts humorous anecdotes, including a lesson on "outwitting a mosquito" and incidents that demonstrate Sri Yukteswar's unusual combination of strict discipline and quiet compassion.  Sri Yukteswar's teaching emphasizes self-realization, and he uses varied methods, including sharp criticism and gentle guidance, to mold his disciples.

## Experiences in Cosmic Consciousness and Miracles

Yogananda describes a profound experience of cosmic consciousness, where his sense of self expands to encompass the entire universe. He sees the universe as a play of light and shadow, emphasizing the impermanence of material reality.  This experience, bestowed by Sri Yukteswar, is followed by a return to mundane tasks, highlighting the importance of balancing spiritual and worldly life.  He recounts stories of Sri Yukteswar’s miracles, often performed subtly and without overt display, such as the incident of the missing cauliflower, which illustrates the yogi’s ability to manipulate subtle energies to achieve seemingly improbable results.


## Astrological Guidance and the Death of Ananta

Sri Yukteswar's teachings on astrology are explained, emphasizing the importance of understanding karmic law rather than fatalistic acceptance of astrological predictions. He guides Yogananda to wear an astrological bangle, foreseeing an illness that is eventually averted through his intervention.  The death of Yogananda's brother Ananta is foreseen in meditation, highlighting the inevitability of karmic law but emphasizing that spiritual practices can alleviate its harshness.  The author burns his astrological chart, showing his faith in self-determination over fate.

##  The Search for Kashi and Further Encounters

Following the death of his young disciple Kashi, Yogananda undertakes a quest to find him in his next rebirth. Employing yogic techniques, he tracks Kashi’s soul to a mother’s womb, demonstrating his ability to perceive beyond the physical plane. This event highlights the yogi's ability to utilize intuition and spiritual means to transcend spatial and temporal limitations. The chapter also features stories of Sri Yukteswar’s interactions with various visitors, further highlighting his wisdom and ability to penetrate the egotistical masks of those who approach him for guidance.  His impartiality is contrasted with the superficial piety of some visitors. 

## Journey to America and Encounters in the West

Yogananda recounts his journey to America and his initial difficulties in adjusting to Western culture. His experiences at the International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston mark his first successful public address in English. He describes his experiences building the Self-Realization Fellowship, including establishing headquarters in Los Angeles and later opening ashrams in Encinitas, Hollywood, and San Diego.  This section emphasizes the blending of Eastern and Western values and the spreading of Kriya Yoga in the West.  His encounters with Luther Burbank and Therese Neumann are detailed.  Burbank’s teachings on the power of love in plant breeding parallel Yogananda's approach to spiritual development.  Therese Neumann's life as a Catholic stigmatist demonstrates the power of faith and spiritual devotion.

##  Sri Yukteswar's Passing and Resurrection

The final sections of the book describe Sri Yukteswar's passing and subsequent resurrection, seen by Yogananda in Bombay.  This event provides a detailed account of the astral world and the nature of karma.  Sri Yukteswar explains the existence of Hiranyaloka, an astral plane where advanced souls continue their spiritual evolution, and he emphasizes the importance of achieving Nirvikalpa Samadhi to transcend the cycle of rebirth.  The book concludes with the establishment of the Encinitas ashram and Yogananda’s vision of a future world community based on spiritual principles and universal brotherhood.  The emphasis on the importance of Kriya Yoga as a scientific technique for spiritual growth is reiterated.  A message of peace and universal brotherhood, culminating with the end of World War II, brings the narrative to a close.
