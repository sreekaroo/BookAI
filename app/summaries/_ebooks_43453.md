# A Pickle for the Knowing Ones: A Summary in Chronological Paragraphs

## The Eccentric Lord Dexter and His Monumental Mansion

Timothy Dexter, born in Malden in 1747, rose from humble beginnings as a leather dresser's apprentice to become a wealthy and famously eccentric man in Newburyport.  His success in various ventures, including leather goods, West India trade, and shrewd investments in state securities, fueled his extravagant lifestyle.  He built a magnificent house, adorned with numerous larger-than-life wooden statues of prominent figures (including himself, with the boastful inscription, "_I am the first in the East, the first in the West, and the greatest philosopher in the Western world_."), minarets, and a golden eagle.  The house's interior matched its flamboyant exterior, filled with imported furniture and paintings. This display clearly reflected Dexter's immense vanity and desire for public recognition, solidifying his image as "Lord Dexter," a title he embraced as the "voice of the people at Large."

## The Poet Laureate and the Parsley Crown

Dexter's vanity extended to appointing a poet laureate, his former apprentice Jonathan Plumer, Jr., a man with a similarly colorful and unconventional background.  Plumer, described in his own autobiography as a "travelling preacher, physician and poet," had a diverse career history including farming, hawking ballads, and even sawing wood.  Plumer's coronation ceremony in Dexter's garden, however, was short-lived, interrupted by a mob of boys.  A sample of Plumer's verse in praise of Dexter is included in the book, providing a glimpse into his poetic style and illustrating the peculiar dynamic between patron and poet.

## "A Pickle for the Knowing Ones": The Book's Unique Style and Content

Dexter, dissatisfied with others' attempts to capture his personality and achievements, took to writing and publishing his own work, "_A Pickle for the Knowing Ones_." The book itself is as eccentric as its author, characterized by a chaotic lack of punctuation in the first edition, which Dexter later rectified (somewhat) by including a separate page filled with punctuation marks, instructing readers to “peper and soolt it as they pleased.” The content is a rambling mix of boasts, opinions on politics and religion, personal anecdotes, business dealings, and bizarre pronouncements.  The text frequently jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions.  Examples abound, from his descriptions of his statues and mansion to his reflections on the nature of presidents, kings, and the clergy.

## Political and Social Commentary: Kings, Presidents, and the "People at Large"

Dexter's writing offers a unique perspective on the political climate of his time. He discusses the roles of presidents and kings, advocating for unity but also expressing skepticism towards political ambition and the pursuit of office.  He asserts that “the Name of presedent is to pleas the peopel at Large,” suggesting a populist view despite his own aristocratic pretensions. His commentary touches on sectional tensions between North and South, urging unity to avoid fragmentation, and critiques the perceived hypocrisy of learned men, specifically referencing those with "Coleage Lant."  He uses vivid, sometimes crude, metaphors to express his views, further highlighting his unconventional approach.

## Religious Views and Criticisms: Priests, Hypocrisy, and the Devil

Dexter's criticisms extend to religious institutions and practices. He is highly critical of the clergy, accusing them of hypocrisy, greed, and manipulating the public through fear and superstition. His language is often blunt and irreverent,  calling priests "hipecricks," "mockers of god," and even associating them with the devil.  His unconventional and often contradictory religious beliefs are apparent,  as he simultaneously expresses a desire for salvation and criticizes religious dogma with statements like, "the preast prech to the Divel for all there hearaes old & youn more or Less the Divel."

## Personal Life and Family Troubles: The "Gost" and the Bishop Affair

The book reveals a less-than-harmonious personal life.  Dexter repeatedly refers to his wife, whom he calls the "gost," and details his strained relationship with her, attributing their 13-year separation to the actions of his son-in-law, Abraham Bishop.  He expresses great displeasure with Bishop's treatment of his daughter Nancy, alleging financial exploitation and cruelty, leading to a divorce and Nancy's descent into intemperance and mental instability.  These personal troubles are interspersed throughout the book, adding another layer of complexity to his eccentric narrative.

## Business Acumen and Speculative Success: Whalebone, Warming Pans, and Bibles

Dexter provides glimpses into his successful business ventures, revealing his astute sense of timing and risk-taking. He details his profits from buying and selling whalebone for ships, warming pans for the West Indies, and even Bibles.  His accounts are punctuated by his characteristic boastfulness and self-promotion, showcasing how he used speculation and unconventional methods to amass his wealth. His recounting of these events demonstrates how he identified undervalued commodities and capitalized on changing market demands.

##  Threats, Attacks, and Imprisonment: A Life of Controversy

Dexter's life was not without its conflicts and controversies. He describes several instances of physical violence, including being beaten by a lawyer and even being involved in a shooting incident with a painter. He recounts being arrested for assault and briefly imprisoned in the county house, proudly noting that he was the first to arrive in his own carriage. These incidents highlight the unpredictable nature of his personality and his confrontational approach to those he perceived as his enemies. His legal problems and physical altercations are interwoven with his more philosophical and religious pronouncements.

##  Death, Legacy, and the Mock Funeral

The preface describes Dexter's preparations for his own death, including a magnificent tomb in his garden and a pre-arranged, elaborate mock funeral. The description of this mock funeral, including a bombastic eulogy and Dexter’s surprise reappearance to cane his wife for not crying, underscores his unconventional and theatrical approach to life, even in death. His extravagant displays, both in life and death, clearly cemented his reputation as a unique and memorable character in Newburyport.

##  The Enduring Mystery of Timothy Dexter

The book ends with a series of cryptic pronouncements and additional anecdotes, revealing a mind that is both shrewd and chaotic. His philosophical ramblings, often intertwined with personal grievances and bizarre opinions, are difficult to interpret clearly, leaving the reader with a sense of the enigmatic nature of this remarkable man.  Despite its flaws, "_A Pickle for the Knowing Ones_" endures as a fascinating testament to a uniquely American character, whose life defied easy categorization and whose legacy remains a subject of fascination and debate.
