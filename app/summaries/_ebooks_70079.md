### 1. The Dawn of Romantic Classicism (1750-1800)

The late 18th and early 19th centuries witnessed a significant shift in architectural style, marked by a reaction against the Baroque. This transition, termed "Romantic Classicism," wasn't abrupt but evolved through various reactions: Academic in Italy, Rococo in France, and Palladian in England.  While Rome served as a crucial hub for disseminating artistic ideas, the revolution truly crystallized in France, drawing heavily from earlier gestation in Rome. Key figures like Winckelmann, Hamilton, and Piranesi—an archaeologist, a painter, and an etcher—shaped the movement alongside architects. Laugier's "Essai sur l’architecture" (1751) offered a crucial critique of the Baroque, advocating Neo-Classicism and Functionalism. Lodoli's functionalist ideas, disseminated by Algarotti, further influenced the burgeoning style.

### 2.  Key Early Works: Hagley and the Panthéon (1750s-1790s)

Two pivotal buildings marked the shift towards Romantic Classicism: James Stuart's Doric Temple at Hagley Park (1758), a pioneering example of re-using the Greek Doric order and attempting an archaeological reconstruction, and J.-G. Soufflot's Sainte-Geneviève (later the Panthéon) in Paris (1757-90).  Stuart's temple, though small, significantly reintroduced the Greek Doric, while Soufflot's Panthéon, a vast cruciform church, showcased a blend of classical and innovative elements. The author highlights Soufflot's unique approach to structure, influenced by Gothic vaulting and presaging future architectural developments.  This building, a transitional piece between Baroque and Romantic Classicism, became a key monument in Paris.

### 3.  The Visionaries: Boullée and Ledoux (1780s-1790s)

The final stages of the Baroque's dissolution and the complete crystallization of Romantic Classicism were dramatically encapsulated in the designs of É.-L. Boullée and C.-N. Ledoux. Boullée, while building little, produced breathtaking projects that showcased simple geometric forms, plain surfaces, and repetitive features.  Ledoux, a successful architect, incorporated elements of his unique style—seen in the Besançon Theatre and the Paris barrières—which emphasized geometric masses and flat surfaces with minimal ornamentation. His most significant contribution, however, was his "L’Architecture," published in 1804, containing his extraordinary projects, including the utopian "Ville Idéale de Chaux," showcasing his unique symbolic approach to architecture.

### 4.  Early Romantic Classicism in England (1790s-1810)

In England, the work of Sir John Soane represented a parallel, significant departure from the Baroque and towards Romantic Classicism. Soane's Bank of England interiors, marked by novel treatment of surfaces, revelation of structural frames, and varied lighting, are cited as examples of his abstract qualities.  However, Soane's style wasn't solely abstract. His work at the Bank also shows his ability to incorporate existing structures into his designs. His other works like the Tyringham gateway exhibit characteristic flat, incised surfaces. This chapter also acknowledges the concurrent development of the Picturesque aesthetic and other revival styles (Indian and Gothic) in England.

### 5.  Early American Architecture: Jefferson to Latrobe (1780s-1810s)

The influence of Romantic Classicism on American architecture is detailed, focusing on the transition from Jefferson's Palladian style to Latrobe's more sophisticated Romantic Classicism. Jefferson’s Virginia State Capitol, inspired by Roman structures, shows an attempt to integrate modern needs into Classical forms, contrasting with the work of Latrobe.  Latrobe, an English-born architect, brought high professional standards and a comprehensive Romantic Classical program to America, leaving an enduring mark on American public architecture, evidenced by his Bank of Pennsylvania and the Baltimore Catholic Cathedral.  The French influence on early American architecture is also examined through architects like Maximilien Godefroy.

### 6.  The Spread of Napoleonic Empire Style (1800-1815)

The Napoleonic era saw a resurgence of French architectural leadership, extending across Europe.  The author discusses prominent Napoleonic monuments in Paris: the Colonne Vendôme, the Arc du Carrousel, and the Arc de Triomphe de l’Étoile, exemplifying the imperial megalomania of the time.  The influence extended beyond France, into cities like Milan, Petersburg, and Naples, where architects adapted Classical and other historical styles to fit the Napoleonic vision, often in collaborations or with designs from exiled or migrating French architects. This section demonstrates the far reach of the Empire style and its dominance in public architecture.

### 7.  Durand's Influence and the Northern European Response (1800-1850)

J.-N.-L. Durand’s "Précis des leçons," a textbook for the École Polytechnique, codified and disseminated Romantic Classicism’s diverse aspects. Durand’s systematic approach to structural systems and building functions is analyzed, noting the prevalence of Italianate, Early Christian, Romanesque, and Gothic inspiration alongside classical paradigms. The author points out Durand's influence on the next generation of architects, especially in Germany and Denmark. Examples like Weinbrenner’s Karlsruhe Marktplatz and Schinkel’s Altes Museum illustrate the adaptation and refinement of Durand’s principles across Northern Europe.

### 8.  Schinkel and the Grecian Revival in Germany (1810-1840s)

Karl Friedrich von Schinkel’s career is presented as a masterful progression through Romantic Classicism. Starting with his Neue Wache, the Schauspielhaus, and the Altes Museum, he demonstrated a unique ability to blend geometrical order with Grecian elements while showcasing his High Romantic sensibilities. The Altes Museum, in particular, highlights his rationalistic handling of Grecian elements, with a notable focus on clarity of mathematical organization and structural expression. The author notes the increasing eclecticism in Schinkel’s later work at Potsdam, incorporating the Picturesque ideal of asymmetry and varied skylines, showcasing his synthesis of classical order and picturesque features.

### 9.  The Rise of the Rundbogenstil and Eclecticism in Germany (1830-1850s)

The Rundbogenstil, a uniquely German style, emerged as an alternative to Grecian Classicism, characterized by the use of arcuated forms and varied skyline treatments.  This chapter notes its prevalence in Southern Germany and other North European countries. The author discusses the work of architects like Gärtner in Munich and Hübsch in Baden, showcasing the increasing eclecticism within the Rundbogenstil.  The chapter further emphasizes the evolving tastes of this period in Germany, noting the preference for polychromy and increasingly elaborate detail while sometimes incorporating Italianate elements.

### 10.  British Architecture: Soane, Nash, and the Regency Era (1810-1830s)

The Regency era in British architecture is examined through the works of Soane and Nash. Soane's unique contributions to interior design at the Bank of England and his highly personal style, characterized by a focus on lighting and abstract effects, are discussed. Nash, on the other hand, focused more on urban development, integrating Picturesque principles into his grand schemes like Regent Street and Regent’s Park. The author notes Nash's mastery in handling urban settings, creating a unique blend of Picturesque ideals and Romantic Classicism. The development of the Picturesque aesthetic is explored further through various examples of house styles, from rustic cottages to asymmetrical mansions.

### 11. The Greek Revival and Renaissance Revival in Britain (1820s-1850s)

The Greek Revival in Britain is detailed, highlighting its increased rigidity and "correctness" compared to earlier phases. Wilkins' Downing College and Smirke’s British Museum are discussed as examples of this refined Grecian style.  The chapter goes on to detail the rise of the Renaissance Revival, which challenged the dominance of the Greek Revival and is particularly exemplified by the works of Charles Barry: his Travellers’ Club and Reform Club, showcasing a more plastic and elaborately detailed approach to Italianate Renaissance design.  Barry’s involvement in the Gothic Revival is also touched upon.

### 12. Picturesque, Gothic Revival, and New Materials in the First Half of the 19th Century (1800-1850s)

The chapter explores the increasing influence of the Picturesque and the Gothic Revival. The Picturesque, primarily a point of view rather than a strict style, is presented as a counter-current to Romantic Classicism, influencing architectural design through features like asymmetrical silhouettes and varied skylines. The rise of the Gothic Revival is explored, contrasting the early, less-archaeological "Gothick" style with the later, more rigorously archaeological approach of Pugin. The chapter concludes by discussing the significant technological developments of the time, particularly the use of iron and glass in construction, culminating in structures like the Crystal Palace.

### 13.  American Architecture in the First Half of the 19th Century (1800-1850s)

This section details the spread of Romantic Classicism in America, from the early work of Jefferson and Latrobe to the later developments of Mills, Strickland, and Rogers. It explores the "Carpenter's Grecian" vernacular style, a distinctly American adaptation of Grecian features to readily available wooden construction. The chapter also highlights the emergence of the Picturesque and Gothic Revival styles in America and points out the early use of new materials like iron and glass in construction, though the chapter notes that the development of these materials was less pronounced in America than in Europe.

### 14. The Second Empire and High Victorian Gothic (1850-1870s)

The second half of the 19th century is characterized by eclecticism.  The Second Empire style, originating in France but gaining widespread international popularity, is analyzed. This style, characterized by mansard roofs and pavilions, was used in both public and private buildings. The author details the influence of the New Louvre in Paris on the style. In contrast, the High Victorian Gothic, primarily an English phenomenon, is examined through the work of Butterfield and Street, emphasizing its use of polychromy and its emphasis on "archaeological correctness". The author notes the differences and overlaps between these two styles, and the differences in their impact in different countries.

### 15.  Late 19th Century Architecture in Britain and America (1870-1900)

The late 19th century saw a shift away from the "High Styles" of the preceding decades, notably in Britain and America. In Britain, Norman Shaw's work is highlighted, demonstrating his eclectic style and versatility,  ranging from High Victorian Gothic to his more characteristic "Queen Anne" style, which focused on regional vernacular. The author shows his influence on domestic architecture, noting the "agglutinative" plan. In America, the "Richardsonian Romanesque" style developed under H. H. Richardson, using materials like granite and brownstone and blending Romanesque and High Victorian Gothic elements with remarkable originality. The chapter also details the development of the 'Shingle Style' in America, its unique blend of materials and informality.

### 16.  The Art Nouveau and its International Impact (1890-1910)

The Art Nouveau movement, originating in Belgium with Victor Horta’s Tassel house, is presented as a response to the eclecticism of the previous period and as a stylistic departure. Its rapid international spread, via periodicals and exhibitions, is discussed along with its use of curving lines, natural motifs, and a blending of structural and decorative elements. The chapter contrasts the Art Nouveau with the works of Sullivan in America,  showing the different ways architects in Europe and America responded to the same influences and the differences in their architectural outcomes.  The chapter explores  the Art Nouveau movement's influence on other European countries like Germany and Austria and contrasts it with the concurrent, more reserved tendencies in Britain.

### 17.  Early 20th Century Modern Architecture: The First Generation (1900-1920s)

The early 20th century saw the rise of a new generation of modern architects, reacting against Art Nouveau's decorative excesses.  The chapter focuses on the first generation of modern architects, such as Auguste Perret in France, known for his pioneering use of reinforced concrete and his focus on expressing structure directly. Frank Lloyd Wright's distinctive "Prairie Houses" are examined, highlighting their unified spaces, flowing layouts, and connection to nature.  The work of Peter Behrens in Germany, particularly his A.E.G. factories, and the contributions of Otto Wagner and Adolf Loos in Austria are also highlighted.

### 18.  The International Style and its Early Manifestations (1920s-1930s)

The 1920s witnessed the emergence of the "International Style," a new architectural language characterized by geometric forms, a focus on functionality, and the use of new materials. The early works of Le Corbusier, Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, and the Dutch architects of the Amsterdam School are presented as key examples.  The chapter highlights how these architects moved beyond the eclecticism of the past, emphasizing the expression of structure and volume through simple forms.  The work of Dudok and Mendelsohn are presented as unique examples of this period, combining modern principles with local characteristics.  The chapter notes that the great economic downturn and the rise of authoritarian regimes in Europe significantly impacted architectural development.

### 19.  Mid-Century Modern Architecture and Beyond (1940s-1960s)

The post-World War II era saw a resurgence of architectural activity, accompanied by a reevaluation of the International Style's principles.  The chapter traces the late work of the leading figures of the previous generation, such as Le Corbusier (Ronchamp and the Unité d'Habitation), Mies van der Rohe (Illinois Institute of Technology and Seagram Building), and Frank Lloyd Wright (Fallingwater and the Guggenheim Museum).  The work of younger architects like Eero Saarinen is also discussed, demonstrating the broader range and eclectic tendencies of mid-century modern architecture.  The chapter ends by exploring the spread of modern architecture globally, with notable examples from Latin America, Scandinavia, and Japan and notes the growing uncertainty in architectural doctrine as the mid-century progressed.
