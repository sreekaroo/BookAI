# Monograms & Ciphers: A Summary

## 1.  Introduction and Scope

The book "Monograms & Ciphers," by A.A. Turbayne of the Carlton Studio, London, offers a practical guide to designing and understanding these letter-based devices.  Turbayne emphasizes the extensive possibilities inherent in monogram and cipher creation, noting that a complete catalog of two-letter combinations alone would require a significant number of plates (147 to be exact, compared to the 135 included).  He highlights the combinatorial explosion when increasing the number of letters, stating that a comprehensive three-letter monogram book would necessitate "17,576 designs," an impractical feat for a single volume.  Turbayne's approach prioritizes a near-complete collection of two-letter designs, providing a foundation upon which more complex arrangements can be built. The introduction also establishes a distinction between monograms (letters forming a single, inseparable unit) and ciphers (letters interlaced but remaining distinct).

## 2.  Design Styles and Principles

The book advocates for simplicity and avoids overly florid designs, reflecting a shift toward "severe chaste forms" in design aesthetics. Turbayne categorizes the included styles into five main types: Roman, Gothic, Sans Serif, Cursive (Running), and Rustic, each presented in light and heavy variations. He introduces three primary design forms: Imposed (letters directly overlapping), Extended (letters side-by-side), and Continuous (letters flowing without interruption).  Turbayne emphasizes that the designs serve as "outlines only" and encourages artists to adapt them to suit their materials and techniques. He explains the importance of the principal letter, suggesting that it be accentuated for better readability and visual balance, regardless of position.

## 3. Monograms vs. Ciphers: A Critical Distinction

Turbayne carefully delineates the difference between monograms and ciphers, criticizing the frequent misidentification of the two. He defines a monogram as "a combination of two or more letters, in which one letter forms part of another and cannot be separated from the whole," contrasting it with a cipher, which is a simpler "interlacing or placing together of two or more letters."  He admits that while monograms are more challenging to design, ciphers often offer superior visual appeal, as evidenced by comparing Plate CXIV (ciphers) to Plate CXV (monograms). The author observes that the challenge with monograms lies not only in their design but ensuring clear legibility for all intended letters, avoiding the appearance of unintended letters.


## 4.  Legibility and Artistic Merit: A Balancing Act

Turbayne grapples with the tension between legibility and artistic merit, particularly in private usage where the design's ornamental value may outweigh its immediate readability.  He cites examples from old French bookbindings where intricate, sometimes illegible, ciphers serve as the primary decorative elements, suggesting that a cipher should first and foremost be a good design, even if slightly obscure.  He states: "If the conceit is legible to the owner, and is of fine proportion as to be thoroughly satisfying to the eye, why should it read like an advertisement?"  This sentiment emphasizes the artistic integrity of the design above purely functional aspects.

## 5. Letter Reversal and Symmetry

The author defends the practice of reversing or rotating letters in monogram and cipher design for enhanced aesthetic appeal and symmetry. He cites the famous HDD monogram of Henry II and Diana of Poitiers as an example of a gracefully balanced design achieved through letter reversal. Turbayne further notes that reversing certain letters allows the creation of designs readable from multiple viewpoints, a valuable asset for objects viewed from different angles (e.g., inlaid furniture, ceilings, or book covers).  He acknowledges that while some letters (H, I, N, O, S, X, Z) naturally possess this symmetry, others (A, M, V, W, Y) require manipulation to achieve the same effect.

## 6.  Style Unity and Design Purity

Turbayne strongly advises against mixing styles within a single device.  He recommends maintaining stylistic consistency, choosing between a monogram or a cipher and avoiding hybrid forms. The only exception he allows is for hyphenated words, where individual components might utilize both monogram and cipher elements. He highlights Plates II (BBA) and XLII (EEO) as illustrations of this exception, but stresses that such exceptions are rare and should be justified by practical needs such as speed and efficiency.

## 7.  Avoiding Design Clutter

The author cautions against excessive line crossings in designs, emphasizing that more than two planes intersecting at one point create visual confusion. He points to several examples (Plates XL, KE; LXXXIX, MMT; XCI, YM) where three or more lines converge, acknowledging that this issue sometimes cannot be avoided without distorting the letterforms. He also mentions designs where letters are placed side-by-side, forming decorative lines (Plates XXIII, XXXIX, XLVII, LX) or are written within each other (Plate XXII, CCG), a useful form for trademarks.

## 8. Style Examples and Specimen Pages

Turbayne provides examples of different letter styles organized into four categories: Roman, Gothic, Cursive, and Rustic.  These are presented on dedicated plates to serve as reference points for different stylistic choices, including examples with light and heavy strokes, foliated elements, and variations suitable for specific crafts like embroidery or stone carving.  These plates (LXXXI, LXXXII, LXXXVII, XCVII; XII, LXXXVIII, XCII, XCIII, C; XIII, XV, LXXXIII, LXXXIV, LXXXV, LXXXVI, XC, XCIX; XI, XX, XXXV, XCI, XCIV, XCV, XCVI, XCVIII) exemplify the range of stylistic possibilities within the book.

## 9. Advanced Designs and Applications

The book features plates showcasing three-letter ciphers and monograms (CXIV-CXVI), firm marks combining two letters with the ampersand (&) (CXVII-CXXI), and company ciphers incorporating '& Co.' (CXXII-CXXVII), including examples of numeral ciphers for years (1905-1909). Plates CXXVIII-CXXXII are dedicated to sacred devices and names, while CXXXIII and CXXXIV offer labels and three-letter monograms from a list of authors. The final plate (CXXXV) demonstrates a stylistic approach to sacred inscriptions.

## 10. Variations and Interpretations of Designs

Turbayne highlights a plate (unnumbered in the summary, but alluded to as a plate added by Mr. Thomas Moring) exhibiting variations on a single design, illustrating how a designer can modify existing forms. This plate demonstrates how subtle alterations in letter treatment and positioning can yield different interpretations or readings while preserving the original design's character.  This section emphasizes the adaptive nature of the designs and highlights the designer's role in refining and interpreting the provided models.  This example reinforces Turbayneâ€™s belief that the patterns included are meant to be flexible and serve as starting points for creative adaptation.
