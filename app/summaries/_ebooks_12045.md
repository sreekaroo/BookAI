### **Ancient Origins and the Italian Renaissance**

The book begins by exploring the surprisingly early presence of women in the fine arts, citing Kora of Sicyonia in the 7th century BC as a designer of bas-reliefs.  While information on ancient Greek and Roman women artists like Calypso and Laya is limited, their existence demonstrates that women participated in art alongside men from antiquity.  The author speculates about the potential contributions of women artists in ancient Egypt, highlighting the powerful roles women held in that society as a basis for this hypothesis. The lack of reliable records before the Italian Renaissance necessitates a shift in focus.  The introduction touches upon the significant role of the Church as an initial patron of Renaissance art, before its evolution to encompass secular themes.  The introduction emphasizes that, while the 13th and 14th centuries are largely absent from records of women artists, they laid the groundwork for the flourishing artistic developments of the 15th and 16th centuries.

### **The 15th Century and the Rise of Flemish Women Artists**

The 15th century, the height of the Italian Renaissance, saw a slow emergence of female artists, with Caterina Vigri and Onorata Rodiana being the few Italian women whose achievements are documented. The introduction notes the considerable challenges faced by women artists during this period, such as the requirement of anatomical study. In contrast, Flanders witnessed more active female participation.  The Van Eyck sisters, particularly Margaretha, are mentioned as important figures, though the precise extent of Margaretha's independent work remains unclear, the author noting the possibility that she contributed significantly to her brothers' famous paintings.

### **The High Renaissance and its Impact on Women**

The latter half of the 15th and the first half of the 16th centuries marked the zenith of the Italian Renaissance.  The author highlights the increased importance of secular subjects alongside religious themes, leading to a new artistic climate that arguably became more welcoming to women. This period also saw the rise of influential female figures in Italian intellectual circles, like Vittoria Colonna and Tullia d'Aragona,  suggesting a more open environment for women generally.  While many women studied in the studios of renowned masters like Titian, detailed records of their individual careers remain sparse. 


### **Venetian Art and its Influence**

The Venetian school of art, known for its glorious color and opulent style, developed later than the Florentine school.  Tintoretto and Veronese, masters of rich color and dramatic composition, defined the Venetian style of the late 16th century. Although many women painted in Venice before the 17th century, the author notes the limited information available about their individual achievements.

### **Art in France and England During the Renaissance**

The Renaissance's impact on France and England differed from its influence in Italy.  While France saw prominent female figures in literature such as Marguerite de Valois, painting lagged behind, with artists like François Clouet more influenced by imported Italian styles than contributing to a distinctly French school.  In England, despite Queen Elizabeth I.'s intellect and patronage of learning, the country lacked a native school of art, relying on imported artists from Flanders, the Netherlands and other nations.  The author quotes Hume's assessment of Elizabeth's vanity in her own learning over encouraging others.  Lady Jane Grey and the daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke serve as examples of learned women of the time.

### **The Sixteenth Century in Germany and the Netherlands**

Germany, in contrast to France and England, possessed a native school of art in Cologne.  In the 16th century, alongside the work of Dürer and Holbein, there was a notable presence of women artists in various parts of the German-speaking world, particularly as miniaturists.  Dürer's journal entry expressing his astonishment at the skills of a young female illuminator exemplifies the surprising level of female artistic achievement.  The same was true of the Netherlands, though few women artists are individually well documented. The author contrasts this with a surge in miniature painting, highlighting a surprising number of female artists in the field.  


### **The Seventeenth Century: Eclecticism and Naturalism in Italy**

The 17th century witnessed a shift in Italian art, with the emergence of two distinct schools: Eclecticism, which aimed to blend various styles of previous masters with a renewed focus on nature, and Naturalism, characterized by a more brutal and realistic depiction of nature.  The Carracci school of Bologna, a center of Eclecticism, fostered a nurturing environment for women artists, including Sofonisba Anguisciola and Elisabetta Sirani. The Naturalistic school, centered in Naples, however, appears to have attracted few women, with Aniella di Rosa paying the ultimate price for her association with it.  Anna Maria Ardoina serves as an example of a multi-talented woman of this period excelling in art, literature, and music.

### **The Seventeenth Century in Other European Countries**

In France during the 17th century, literature overshadowed painting among women, with figures like Madame de Maintenon and Madame de Sévigné becoming more prominent than their visual art counterparts.  Elizabeth Chéron represents one of the few exceptions in literature and visual art. In Flanders, Belgium, and Holland, the 17th century was a significant period for painting, but Rubens and Rembrandt had few female imitators. The author highlights the exceptions like Anna Breughel (genre painting), the Terburg sisters, and Maria and Gottfried Schalken, showcasing the familial nature of artistic collaboration and the increasing acceptance of female artistic talent in certain areas.  Flower painting, however, thrived with Maria van Oosterwyck and Rachel Ruysch reaching notable heights.

### **Eighteenth Century Art: Eclecticism and the Rise of Women Artists**

The 18th century in Italy saw a decline in artistic originality. The author notes that the art of the period was largely academic and lacks the depth of previous centuries. However, women began to achieve more prominence in higher education and the arts, with examples such as Maria Portia Vignoli (natural sciences) and Matilda Festa (Academy of St. Luke).  In France, the eclecticism of the Rococo style dominated.  Although many women artists existed, only Adelaide Vincent and Elizabeth Vigée Le Brun stand out in historical records.  Germany became the most productive country in terms of the sheer number of women artists, surpassing both France and Italy.

### **Nineteenth Century Art: Expansion and New Movements**

The 19th century marked a period of dramatic expansion in art, marked by the increased inclusion of diverse subjects and the invention of new artistic methods.  The author notes a shift towards greater realism, combined with idealism,  illustrated by the works of Corot, Courbet, Puvis de Chavannes, and Gustave Moreau.  The rise of landscape painting, championed by Constable and Turner in England, influenced French artists like Rousseau, Corot, and Millet. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Impressionism, represented by figures like Manet, Monet, and Berthe Morisot, further revolutionized artistic styles.  Sculpture experienced a similar revival, with artists like Rodin and St. Gaudens leading the way towards more expressive and naturalistic works.  The author concludes by highlighting the growing opportunities for women in art education and the recognition of their achievements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, even noting a greater willingness to accept and reward their talent in France. The text closes with extensive biographical information on many individual women artists, detailing their training, notable works, and the context of their artistic careers.
