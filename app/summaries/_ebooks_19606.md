## 3. Introductory Remarks and Collection Overview

The introduction provides a general description of the 1881 archaeological and ethnological collections from Zuñi, New Mexico, and the Tusayan pueblos in Northeastern Arizona.  The total number of specimens is stated as approximately 4,900. Stevenson notes the predominance of clay artifacts, referencing his prior catalogues for further details on their creation and characteristics.  He emphasizes the significance of the roughly 150 hunting and war amulets, noting their importance in Zuñi culture and referring the reader to Cushing's "Zuñi Fetiches" (Second Annual Report of the Bureau for 1882) for further analysis of their history, traditions, and uses.  The introduction also previews the different material categories: stone, clay, vegetal substances, and animal substances.


## 4. Zuñi Stone Artifacts: Axes, Metates, and Mortars

The catalogue meticulously documents Zuñi stone artifacts.  Axes are described in detail, noting variations in size, condition (from "quite perfect" to "more or less impaired"), grooving, and cutting edges.  Examples like Nos. 65890 (double-grooved) and 65886 (with a raised square at the butt for hafting) illustrate the range of axe types. Metates are categorized by their function: grinding paint (Nos. 66320, 66313), reducing cracked corn to meal (Nos. 66316-66319), and producing flour (No. 66324).  Mortars are similarly categorized based on use (paint grinding, food preparation), with examples like No. 2119 (fine-grained stone, paint-mill for sacred colors) and No. 66251 (malpais, grinding chili).


## 5. Zuñi Stone Artifacts: Mullers and Miscellaneous Objects

Mullers, used in conjunction with metates and mortars, are described in terms of their original function and adaptation for various tasks such as preparing sauces (Nos. 66071-66004), grinding corn (No. 66227), and polishing (No. 65984).  The "Miscellaneous objects" section includes polishing stones (Nos. 65940-65951), pestles (Nos. 66067-66066), war knives (Nos. 65936-65937), and sacred idol stones (Nos. 66079-66080).  Plate XL illustrates the method of polishing pottery.


## 6. Zuñi Hunting and War Amulets: Detailed Descriptions

This section details the 150 hunting and war amulets, representing significant animals (mountain lion, coyote, wild cat, wolf, eagle, mole) and incorporating elements like arrowheads, turquoise, shell, and coral.  Each amulet's unique features, including material, size, and associated decorations, are recorded, along with the Zuñi names.  Amulets No. 1 (mountain lion with turquoise eyes and blood) and No. 21 (pottery representation of the wild cat) exemplify the detailed descriptions provided.


## 7. Zuñi Clay Artifacts: Water Jars, Bottles, and Canteens

The catalogue systematically lists Zuñi clay artifacts.  Water jars ("Tinajas"), ranging from one to six gallons, are described, emphasizing the variety of colored designs.  Examples are noted with their patterns and occasionally the location of origin. Water bottles and canteens are categorized by size and capacity, ranging from one pint to three gallons.  The text details their designs, noting less elaborate ornamentation compared to the water jars. Plate XLI shows examples of Zuñi vases and canteens, including fig. 3 which depicts a canteen with phallic frog imagery.


## 8. Zuñi Clay Artifacts: Pitchers, Cups, Bowls, and Cooking Pots

The section on pitchers (Nos. 67110-67141) notes variations in size, material, and decoration, also mentioning milk pitchers.  Drinking cups and cup-shaped vessels (Nos. 67091-67143) are described, highlighting features like handles, flaring rims, and decorations. Bowls and baskets (Nos. 67184-67345) are a major component of this section, with extensive descriptions and categorization based on purpose (sacred meal, bread, paint) and decoration (tadpole, horned frog, butterfly, rosette). The descriptions of cooking pots (Nos. 67327-67484) note their plain black ware, sometimes with legs.


## 9. Zuñi Clay Artifacts: Ladles, Condiment Vessels, and Paint Pots/Jars

Ladles and spoons (Nos. 67709-67739) are detailed by material and decoration, including human faces and birds. Condiment vessels (Nos. 67389-67405) encompass salt and pepper jars and pots. Paint pots and jars (Nos. 67403-67559) are described in terms of their size, shape, compartmentalization (if present), and decorations, with examples like No. 67404 (compartments for fire god paints). Effigies and figures are also noted including animals and humans.


## 10. Zuñi Vegetal and Animal Substances: A Diverse Range of Objects

The catalogue proceeds to discuss vegetal substances, which include various utensils and implements such as baskets, trays, water-jugs, corn-planters, bows, arrows, sieves, and gaming-blocks.  Emphasis is placed on the basketry's craftsmanship and the variety of sizes and decorative schemes.  Examples are given with Zuñi names, with the note about the ingenuity and skills in the manufacture of such articles.  The loom implements (Nos. 69692-69842) section lists items for weaving serapes, blankets, belts, and garters.  Implements for war and the chase (Nos. 69455-69675) including clubs, bows, and arrows are described.  The description of gambling implements focuses on the sacred games, including the hidden ball. Dance implements (Nos. 69264-69265) include gourd rattles.  Animal substances include leather items, bone awls, and horn arrow-straighteners. Plate XLII depicts the method of drilling turquoises and Plate XLIII shows the Moki method of dressing hair.



## 11. Wolpi (Arizona) Collections: A Comparative Overview

The catalogue then shifts focus to the collections from Wolpi, Arizona.  The organization mirrors that of the Zuñi section: stone artifacts (axes, mortars, mullers, etc.), clay artifacts (vases, bowls, canteens, etc.), vegetal substances (basketry, gourds, etc.), and animal substances (bone, horn, feathers, leather, etc.).  This allows for a direct comparison between the artifact types and styles of the two pueblos.  While specific item numbers are provided, the level of detail is less extensive than the Zuñi catalogue.


## 12.  Wolpi Basketry and Other Vegetal Materials

The Wolpi basketry is described with similar detail to Zuñi basketry, emphasizing its function (carrying loads, trays, etc.) and styles of weaving.  The section on gourds, bows, arrows, rattles, and other items is less detailed than the Zuñi section, though still provides Zuñi names and use descriptions.  Plate XLIV displays the Moki method of spinning.


## 13. Wolpi Head-dresses, Dance Ornaments, and Images

The highly decorative Wolpi head-dresses, dance ornaments, and images are described in detail, highlighting the materials (wicker, leather, cotton, wood, corn husks, feathers), colors, and symbolic forms.  The description emphasizes the vivid colors (green, red, black, white, yellow, blue) and the use of conventionalized human figures in the decorations.  The descriptions are accompanied by item numbers that allow the reader to follow the description through images.


## 14. Wolpi Weaving Implements and Animal Products

The final sections detail the implements for weaving, using similar descriptive methods to those used for Zuñi weaving implements, and then concludes with a description of animal products from Wolpi, including horn and bone items, feathers, and woven fabrics and skins or leather.  The level of detail in these sections is similar to that of the comparable sections in the Zuñi description.


## 15. Conclusion: Significance of the Catalogue

Stevenson's catalogue stands as a valuable record of the material culture of the Zuñi and Wolpi pueblos in 1881.  Its detailed descriptions, including Zuñi names and use information where available, offer insights into the daily lives, ceremonial practices, and artistic traditions of these indigenous communities. The meticulous cataloguing, complemented by illustrations, provides a rich resource for researchers studying Southwestern Native American archaeology and ethnography.  The use of illustrations, like those in Plates XL, XLI, XLII, and XLIII, provides context and enhances the understanding of the artifacts' creation and use.
