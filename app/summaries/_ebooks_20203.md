# Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography: A Summary in Chronological Paragraphs

## Humble Beginnings in Boston (1706-1717)

Benjamin Franklin's autobiography begins with his ancestry, tracing his family back three hundred years in England to a freehold of about thirty acres.  His grandfather, Thomas, was a notable figure in his community, a similarity Franklin later notes between his own life and his grandfather's.  His father, Josiah, a pious and prudent man, relocated the family to Boston in 1682 seeking religious freedom, eventually settling on tallow-chandler and soap-boiler as a trade to support his large family.  Young Benjamin, showing early signs of leadership and a love of reading, was initially intended for the clergy, attending grammar school for a year before his father shifted his plans due to financial constraints. The quote, "Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean men," from Solomon's Proverbs, became a guiding principle in his life instilled by his father.


## Apprenticeship and Early Literary Pursuits (1717-1723)

At age twelve, Franklin was apprenticed to his brother James, a printer, a trade he preferred to his father's.  His love of reading continued, fueled by access to his brother's printing house and the kindness of Mr. Matthew Adams, who lent him books from his library. Franklin's early attempts at writing poetry, though unsuccessful, led him to explore prose writing, inspired by the _Spectator_. He developed a meticulous method of self-improvement in writing, translating prose into verse and back again to refine his style and develop clarity and method in his expression, "I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting and using them." This rigorous self-education laid the foundation for his later success as a writer and communicator.


## Conflict with His Brother and Escape to Philadelphia (1723-1724)

A dispute with his brother James, fueled by James's harsh treatment and Franklin's growing ambition, led to a rift.  James's newspaper, the _New England Courant_, caused controversy, and James was imprisoned for refusing to reveal his authors.  During his brother's imprisonment, Franklin took over the paper, writing anonymously and further antagonizing the authorities. He eventually asserted his freedom from his apprenticeship and, facing his brother's obstruction of finding work in Boston, fled to Philadelphia at seventeen. His journey was arduous, marked by a storm, a near-drowning, and exhaustion. His arrival in Philadelphia was humble, marked by his description of a "most awkward, ridiculous appearance".


##  Early Philadelphia Life and Governor Keith's False Promises (1724-1726)

Franklin found work with printer James Keimer, a man he found to be incompetent but surprisingly civil to him. He quickly learned Keimer’s business, impressing others with his skill and intellect, while also forming relationships and making a courtship to Deborah Read. Governor William Keith’s offer to support him setting up his own print shop appeared generous, but after arriving in London, Franklin discovered the promises were hollow. Keith provided no letters of credit or recommendation as he'd promised; Franklin's hopes of quickly establishing a successful print business were dashed by this deception.


## London Years and Return to Philadelphia (1726-1727)

Franklin worked for several printers in London, improving his skills and broadening his intellectual circles, while his friendship with James Ralph proved financially damaging.  He learned languages, and his engagement with Miss Read waned during his absence. This period reflects both Franklin’s self-improvement and his mistakes – excessive spending and neglecting his relationship. Upon his return to Philadelphia, he found that Miss Read had married another man.  His former employer, Keimer, was faltering, a situation Franklin saw as an opportunity.


## Partnership and the Junto (1727-1729)


Returning to Philadelphia, Franklin partnered with Hugh Meredith, establishing a printing business with borrowed funds.  He also developed the Junto, a club of mutual improvement, which he established in 1727 with friends. The club’s rules emphasized sincere inquiry after truth and discouraged contentious debate.  This period highlights Franklin's growing influence and his strategic approach to establishing beneficial relationships and pursuing his goals, with a quote, "The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid," as an example.


## Public Service and Moral Perfection (1729-1733)


Franklin’s printing business prospered, and he became more involved in public affairs. His anonymous pamphlet advocating for a paper currency illustrates his influence.  He served as clerk of the General Assembly, securing a steady income, while his Junto continued its activities.  In 1733, he established a plan for achieving moral perfection, using a system of self-examination and adherence to thirteen virtues.  He admits that he didn't achieve perfect adherence to his moral plan but that the endeavor still improved him, his famous quote showing the importance of this plan to his life: "It was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection. I wish’d to live without committing any fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into."


## Marriage and Public Library (1730-1735)

Franklin married Deborah Read in 1730, finding happiness and support in their partnership.  He continued his public service through his newspaper, the _Pennsylvania Gazette_, promoting moral instruction and civic engagement, avoiding libeling and personal attacks. His emphasis on the pursuit of good was supported by his refusal of a patent for the Franklin stove. The establishment of Philadelphia's first subscription library marked a major contribution to the city's intellectual development; he skillfully avoided undue attention to himself in this enterprise.


## _Poor Richard's Almanac_ and Religious Views (1732-1739)

Franklin published _Poor Richard's Almanac_ for twenty-five years, using it as a vehicle for spreading his maxims on industry, frugality, and virtue.  The work’s success was considerable, reaching widespread popularity.  His religious beliefs evolved from Presbyterianism to Deism, eventually settling on a pragmatic approach to morality, emphasizing sincerity, integrity, and the importance of doing good.  His quote, "I grew convinc'd that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life," reveals his mature moral philosophy.


##  Further Public Service and the Albany Plan of Union (1739-1754)

Franklin’s influence continued to grow, participating in numerous civic initiatives, including fire company organization and improvements to the city's infrastructure.  His involvement with the evangelist George Whitefield is recounted, highlighting his charitable contributions and demonstrating his respect for Whitefield despite their differing beliefs. He also attended sermons of the Reverend Mr. Hemphill, becoming his zealous partisan.  In 1754, he proposed the Albany Plan of Union at a colonial congress, aiming to unite the colonies for defense against France. The plan was rejected as it was considered having too much of both "prerogative" and "democratic" elements by the colonists and the English government respectively.


## The French and Indian War and Braddock's Defeat (1754-1757)

With the outbreak of the French and Indian War, Franklin played a crucial role in supplying Braddock's expedition with wagons and horses, exhibiting remarkable organizational skills and financial risk-taking, despite Braddock's disdain for colonial troops.  Braddock's defeat highlighted the shortcomings of British military strategies and the importance of utilizing local knowledge. Franklin's actions, while ultimately unrewarded directly for political reasons, established his reputation for resourcefulness and commitment.  The quote, "_We shall better know how to deal with them another time_," from Braddock's aide, Captain Orme, speaks volumes about how future military engagements against the French would likely unfold, which would only prove true years later in the Revolutionary War.


## Later Years and Legacy

The concluding pages detail Franklin's further roles as a public servant, focusing on his efforts towards establishing the University of Pennsylvania and the many public works and reforms he initiated in Philadelphia, many of which remain part of the city's fabric.  He details his successes in managing the American post office, and his scientific experiments with electricity, which earned him international recognition and membership in the Royal Society.   His later years were marked by his role as Pennsylvania's agent in London, where he navigated complex political and economic disputes. His efforts reveal his exceptional diplomatic skills and unwavering commitment to Pennsylvania's welfare, while also illustrating the growing tension between the colonies and Great Britain.  He famously quoted this line from Addison’s _Cato_  as a personal motto:  "Here will I hold. If there's a power above us (And that there is, all nature cries aloud Thro' all her works), He must delight in virtue; And that which he delights in must be happy."  His autobiography, while unfinished, stands as a testament to his life, filled with both pragmatic wisdom and genuine humility.
