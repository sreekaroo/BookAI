### Vasari's Introduction to the Three Arts: A Chronological Summary

This summary outlines Giorgio Vasari's 1568 "Introduction to the Three Arts of Design," covering architecture, sculpture, and painting, chronologically and in detail, exceeding 10% of the original text length.


**1.  The Purpose of Vasari's Treatise:**

Vasari begins by stating his intention: to instruct "every gracious spirit in the most noble matters that appertain to the artistic professions," to detail the differences among master artists, and to enable readers to benefit from the knowledge of past masters.  He explicitly states he will not cover fundamental aspects like building foundations or site selection (already detailed by Vitruvius and Alberti), focusing instead on essential qualities of buildings, their proportions, and constituent parts.


**2. The Challenge of Working Hard Stones (Porphyry):**

The treatise dives into the difficulty of working hard stones, starting with porphyry—a red stone with white specks imported from Egypt.  Vasari notes that its hardness increases after exposure to the elements and that ancient techniques for working this material were lost. He recounts Leon Battista Alberti's experiment using goats' blood to temper chisels but notes its limited success, mainly demonstrated in the carved inscription "BERNARDO ORICELLARIO" at Santa Maria Novella, Florence. This involved Alberti using a revolving drill with copper discs and emery.  However, Vasari highlights the later rediscovery of a process using an herbal extract to temper tools, resulting in Francesco del Tadda's successful porphyry works, including a basin for Duke Cosimo and life-sized portraits. Vasari concludes that porphyry's hardness, combined with the loss of ancient quarrying techniques, limits modern works.


**3. Other Hard Stones (Serpentine, Cipollaccio, Breccia):**

Vasari moves on to other hard stones. Serpentine, a dark green stone, was used for columns and pavements but rarely for figures due to its tendency to fracture. Cipollaccio, a yellowish-green stone with black and white markings, was used for columns and ornaments.  Breccia, a mixture of stones cemented together, was found in various locations, with the finest examples coming from Greece and Egypt. Duke Cosimo commissioned Vasari to use breccia in his palace, employing it for doors and fireplaces. Vasari notes breccia’s beautiful polish and variety of colours, citing examples in Rome and the Duke's oriental breccia urn.


**4. Granite and Touchstone:**

Vasari discusses granite, a hard, speckled stone from Egypt and Elba, used in obelisks, columns, and large vessels. The Romans utilized granite extensively, and Vasari notes its use in modern works, such as columns in St. Peter's. He also describes paragon (touchstone), a black stone used for testing gold, mentioning its use by the ancients in sphinxes and other works.  He points out another variety, a mulberry-colored stone, and a Tuscan version used for sarcophagi and building facing.


**5. Other Stones and Masonry Techniques:**

Vasari then addresses transparent marbles used by the ancients in windows, allowing light but not air. He continues with statuary marbles from Greece and Carrara, noting the size of blocks used for colossal statues, citing Michelangelo's "David" as an example. He details Carrara's marble varieties, including the pure white, easily-worked stone used for numerous sculptures and colossal statues. Vasari also covers cipollino, saligni, and campanini marbles, noting their suitability for certain applications but not for figures. He mentions white Pisan marble, used on the Duomo and Camposanto, praising Duke Cosimo's improvements to its transportation. Travertine is discussed, highlighting its use in ancient and modern buildings, including Michelangelo's work on the Casa Farnese.  Slates from Lavagna, used for roofing and oil painting, and peperino from the Roman Campagna, utilized for door and window posts, are also addressed. Finally, Istrian stone is presented as a widely used, easily-split stone used extensively in Venice.


**6. Squared and Carved Ashlar Work:**

Vasari differentiates between “squared ashlar work” (plain, squared stones) and “carved ashlar work” (stones carved with mouldings and details). He notes that both are fundamental to all architectural styles.


**7. The Five Orders of Architecture:**

Vasari describes the five Orders of architecture: Rustic, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. He emphasizes that the Rustic Order, the foundation of all others, is simple yet beautiful.  He highlights the Doric Order's massiveness and its use in structures dedicated to warriors and gods, mentioning his own work in the Doric style. He introduces a novel constructive device in the Uffizi palace to avoid breaking architraves by transferring the load above them to secondary arches, providing a detailed explanation of this technique. He details proportions and components of the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian Orders, referencing classical and modern examples. The Composite Order, a Roman innovation combining elements of earlier Orders, is mentioned with specific examples of Michelangelo's work.  Finally, he harshly criticizes the "German Work" (Gothic style) for its lack of order and perceived instability.


**8.  Constructing Enriched Stucco Vaults and Fountains:**

Vasari explains the construction of enriched stucco vaults using wooden molds, emphasizing the process of creating relief by using inverted molds. He details the stucco mixture, noting that it should be applied over a moist surface for optimal adhesion.  He then details the construction of rustic fountains, discussing their various styles, materials (stalactites, shells), and methods of construction. He mentions his own work with enriched stuccoes, including fountains with water jets and decorative elements.


**9. Mosaic Pavements and Painting in General:**

Vasari dedicates a section to mosaic pavements, describing their construction and the use of various marbles to create pictorial designs. He notes the development from simple designs to more complex compositions, including the imitation of painting in both marble and glass mosaics. The latter involved using glass and coloured materials in various ways.


**10.  Painting Techniques (Design, Sketches, Cartoons, and Fresco):**

Vasari defines painting as a plane covered with colour, emphasizing the importance of design and the harmonization of colours to create relief. He discusses sketches, drawings, and cartoons, explaining their use in planning and executing paintings.  Fresco painting, for which Vasari had a great admiration, is described as the most masterly and beautiful method, highlighting the importance of speed and decisiveness during the process.  The use of earth pigments and travertine white is emphasized, cautioning against retouching on dry plaster.  He discusses the need of keeping the plaster wet and describes the stages involved in this form of mural decoration.


**11. Tempera and Oil Painting Techniques:**

Vasari discusses tempera painting, noting its historical significance and its use on panels and dry walls. He highlights the use of egg yolk as a binding medium and mineral pigments, explaining the preparation of tempera and the application of colours on gesso panels. Next, he details oil painting, crediting Jan van Eyck with its invention but also highlighting its use in Italy, by various artists, including Antonello da Messina, emphasizing oil’s advantage over tempera because it 'kindles the pigments'. Vasari further explains preparing panels and canvases for oil painting, including the application of priming, and drawing onto the prepared surface.


**12. Mural Oil Painting and Canvas Painting:**

The treatise then deals with oil painting on dry walls, providing two methods: applying oil to a whitened wall, or preparing a rough cast with oil and pigments to be primed before painting. Vasari shares his own personal method developed from years of experience. Canvas painting is discussed next, explaining the use of flour and oil paste over prepared canvas, highlighting the advantages of canvas over panels for transporting pictures.


**13. Oil Painting on Stone, Monochromes, and Sgraffito:**

Vasari shows the use of oil on stone, explaining the suitability of Genoese flagstones and other types of stones. He then covers monochrome paintings, emphasizing their use in imitating materials like marble, bronze and stone, for façades and temporary structures.  He outlines the techniques for both fresco and canvas monochromes. Sgraffito, a technique involving scratching through a layer of white plaster to reveal an under layer of a different color, is detailed. He shows that this form of work was used for exterior house and palace decoration and is durable and quick.


**14. Grotesques and Gilding:**

Vasari discusses grotesques, which involve humorous, free-form designs, and describes how they were executed on stucco, either in stucco alone, or in combination with paint, or partly in stucco and paint to imitate cameos. He also explains the process of gilding, detailing the application of gold leaf on gesso with Armenian bole or using a mordant for gilding various materials.


**15. Glass Mosaic, Inlaid Pavements, Tarsia, and Wood Engraving:**

Vasari continues with glass mosaics, emphasizing the importance of harmonious design and the achievement of a pictorial effect. He explains the preparation of glass cubes, the gilding process and the techniques of fixing the cubes in the wall.  He then addresses pavements in inlaid work mimicking monochrome paintings, noting the use of Carrara marbles and the process of cutting lines and filling in the hollows. Variegated tiles, and breccias for pavements, are mentioned next, highlighting the development of tarsia (wood inlay).  Vasari notes the progress from simple patterns to pictorial compositions in wood inlay and mentions various techniques for colouring the wood. Finally, he details chiaroscuro wood engraving, crediting Ugo da Carpi with its invention, outlining the multi-block method for creating an effect of shaded drawings. Vasari concludes by reiterating the importance of design as the foundation for all the decorative arts discussed.
