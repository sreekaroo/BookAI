### The Venetian Lagoon: A Unique Setting

John Ruskin begins *The Stones of Venice, Volume 2* by describing the unforgettable approach to Venice by gondola, contrasting the initial, somewhat underwhelming view of the city with the awe-inspiring spectacle of its emergence from the seemingly boundless Adriatic Sea.  He emphasizes the unique character of the Venetian lagoon, a shallow expanse of water punctuated by islands and marked by shifting tides and seaweed. This setting, far from being merely picturesque, is presented as a crucial factor shaping Venice's history and architecture.  The description evokes a sense of both wonder and foreboding: "a black desert of their shore lies in its nakedness beneath the night, pathless, comfortless, infirm, lost in dark languor and fearful silence," a stark contrast to the romantic ideal of Venice.  Ruskin highlights the crucial role of the tides, arguing that slight variations in their height would have profoundly altered Venice's development and character.

### Torcello: A Testament to Humble Faith

Ruskin shifts his focus to Torcello, an island seven miles north of Venice, now desolate but once a significant settlement.  The author details the small, unassuming group of buildings, including the cathedral, a convent, and the "Palazzo pubblico."  He emphasizes the cathedral's unadorned exterior and its remarkable interior luminosity, a stark contrast to the gloomier contemporary churches of mainland Italy. Ruskin interprets the cathedral's simple yet dignified design as a reflection of the exiles' spiritual condition: "men who had no home left them upon earth, but who looked for one to come," their faith expressed in their choice of mosaic subjects focusing on Christ's mercy and future judgment. He analyses the detailed carvings of capitals, pulpit, and chancel screen, noting their combination of careful execution and inventive freedom.  The pulpit, in particular, is lauded for its simple elegance and suitability for its purpose.

### Murano: A Mirror of Venetian Decline

Ruskin's journey continues to Murano, once a vibrant suburb of Venice filled with pleasure palaces and gardens, now sadly marked by decay and a stark contrast between the past and present. He observes the modern cemetery wall replacing the gardens, a poignant symbol of the city's decline.  Murano's remaining buildings, though dilapidated, still retain traces of their former grandeur, including marble doorways and windows.  Ruskin discusses the history of the Murano cathedral (San Donato), tracing its legendary founding to a vow by Emperor Otto the Great and the later addition of St. Donato's relics. He details the ongoing conflict between the cathedral and other Murano churches over authority.  The cathedral's interior, sadly marred by later restorations, still showcases the remarkable 1140 mosaic pavement, which Ruskin connects to the future glory of Venetian color in Titian's works.

### St. Mark's: A Book of Common Prayer

The description of St. Mark's Basilica forms the central part of the chapter, Ruskin contrasting the magnificent, multi-layered architecture with the indifference of the present-day Venetians who largely ignore its beauty and splendor. He traces the church’s history, noting its Byzantine origins, Gothic additions, and 17th-century mosaic restorations.  He recounts the legendary discovery of St. Mark's relics, symbolized in a contemporary mosaic, and points to inconsistencies between these depictions and the actual existing architecture as evidence of subsequent alterations. Ruskin emphasizes that St. Mark's is primarily an example of incrusted architecture, where precious materials cover a brick core. He defines the principles governing this style, highlighting the honesty of the construction, the use of various colored marble, and the shallow nature of the sculpture.  

### St. Mark's: Architectural Analysis

Ruskin establishes seven laws governing Byzantine incrusted architecture: light and delicate plinths and cornices, abandonment of complex inner structure, solid shafts, shafts’ variable size and potential independence from structural needs, use of symmetrical alabaster patterns, shallow sculptural carving, and independence of overall impression from sheer size. He argues that the beauty of St. Mark's is primarily based on its use of color and intricately detailed decoration, qualities often missed by those trained only in the appreciation of form.  He illustrates this by analyzing a fragment of an archivolt, showcasing the complexity of its color and design. 

### St. Mark's: Religious and Artistic Significance

Ruskin then tackles the question of the suitability of St. Mark's rich ornamentation for its religious purpose. He challenges the common assumption that this richness is inherently religious, arguing instead that in its time, it was simply a continuation of a more general style found in Venetian homes and public buildings. He suggests that the church’s present lack of impact on its worshippers stems from this severance of architecture from daily life, along with the loss of understanding of the mosaics’ narrative. He contrasts the positive influence of even a dilapidated English cathedral with the lack of such effect in St. Mark's.

### St. Mark's: The Mosaics as Scripture

The chapter continues with an examination of St. Mark's mosaics, which Ruskin views as the “illuminations” of a great illuminated manuscript Bible. He describes the progression of the narratives in the various domes and arches, beginning with the Old Testament history for catechumens in the atrium and culminating in the life, death, and ascension of Christ in the main domes.  The mosaics emphasize Christ’s mercy and judgment, the Holy Spirit’s power, and the importance of sanctification. The choice of subjects reinforces the church's role as not just a place of worship but a visual testament of Christian faith.

### Byzantine Palaces: Subtlety of Proportion

Ruskin shifts to the examination of Byzantine palaces, noting their similar use of incrustation and round arches as St. Mark’s.  He analyzes their remarkably subtle proportions, using detailed measurements to highlight the careful mathematical harmonies underlying their seemingly irregular designs.  He provides specific examples—Fondaco de’ Turchi, Casa Loredan, Casa Farsetti, and others—demonstrating the consistent application of these refined proportions across various buildings.  This detailed analysis showcases the Venetian architects' mastery of spatial relationships, lost in later architectural styles.

### Byzantine Capitals: Convex and Concave Forms

The focus moves to the capitals of Byzantine palaces, which Ruskin divides into convex and concave groups, likening them to the shapes of water lilies and convolvulus flowers respectively.  He analyzes the different styles of ornamentation, highlighting the vitality and naturalistic details of the convex capitals found in the palaces.  He contrasts these with the simpler concave capitals, noting their different applications in the palaces' designs.  The discussion emphasizes the "life" and "breadth" of the Byzantine capitals, reflecting the designers' love of natural forms and their masterful use of grand curves to unify the details.

### Gothic Palaces: Transition and Centralization

Ruskin now turns his attention to the transition from Byzantine to Gothic architecture in Venice, observing the gradual change in the form of palaces.  The Byzantine long arcades are replaced by more compartmentalized arrangements of doors and windows. While initially the central windows retain some Byzantine importance, the author notes the loss of the consistent centralization in ornamentation and proportion found in earlier buildings. This shift is illustrated with measurements and descriptions of window types, tracking the evolution of the arch from Byzantine forms to the fully developed pointed arch of the Gothic period. He introduces the concept of "orders" to categorize these transitions and discusses the specific features of the palaces of each "order."  He also describes examples of early Gothic elements alongside later Byzantine, showing a process of artistic blending and adaptation.

### The Ducal Palace: A Synthesis of Styles

Ruskin concludes by focusing on the Ducal Palace, the pinnacle of Venetian Gothic architecture and a model for later buildings. He details its complex history, built and rebuilt over centuries in successive architectural styles, starting with the Byzantine Palace of Doge Participazio, followed by the Gothic Palace under Doge Gradenigo, and finally incorporating Renaissance elements.  He describes the Palace's arrangement and key features, highlighting the daring sacrifice of external symmetry for internal functionality in the placement of windows. He provides an account of the different sections of the Palace constructed at different times, the reasons behind these additions (including the addition of a new Council Chamber), and the fires that necessitated repairs and renovations.  He also examines the sculpture and capitals of the Palace, interpreting their symbolic meaning and tracing their artistic evolution.  The chapter highlights the transition from the frank confession of human frailty in the early Gothic sculptures to a more self-assured Renaissance style.  The final section laments the ongoing destruction of priceless paintings within the palace caused by a lack of appreciation and understanding of their artistic merit.
