# Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant: A Summary

Here's a chronological summary of Ulysses S. Grant's *Personal Memoirs*, exceeding 10% of the original text length, divided into detailed paragraphs:

## Humble Beginnings and West Point

Grant's memoirs begin with a detailed account of his ancestry, tracing his lineage back to Mathew Grant, who arrived in America in 1630.  He highlights his family's American roots and their involvement in earlier wars, noting his great-grandfather's participation in the French and Indian War and his grandfather's service in the Revolutionary War. His father, Jesse R. Grant, a self-educated and politically engaged tanner, instilled in Grant a love of reading and a thirst for knowledge despite his own limited formal education.  Grant's early life in Georgetown, Ohio, involved both schooling and hard work, including farm labor and even early entrepreneurial ventures like horse trading, which he humorously recounts. His childhood experiences shaped his character, teaching him resourcefulness and self-reliance.

## West Point and Early Army Career

At age seventeen, Grant unexpectedly received an appointment to West Point, a decision influenced by his father's belief that he would succeed and by Grant's own desire to travel.  His time at the Academy is characterized by a lack of studiousness, a preference for reading novels over assigned texts, and an eventual demotion from sergeant to private due to his poor conduct record. Despite this, he passed his examinations, exhibiting a talent for mathematics that contrasted with his low performance in French.  Grant's early years in the army, stationed at Jefferson Barracks, were marked by a lack of interest in a military career and his initial ambition to pursue a career in academia. However, his experiences and encounters at Jefferson Barracks and Camp Salubrity, Louisiana, laid the foundation for future military service. His time in Louisiana allowed him to strengthen his relationship with Julia Dent, and eventually propose marriage.

## The Mexican-American War

Grant's perspective on the Mexican-American War is strongly anti-war, viewing it as an unjust conflict driven by expansionist desires rather than legitimate grievances. He explicitly states, "It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory."  He served in several key battles, including Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma, noting the effectiveness of General Taylor's command and his own surprising lack of fear in the face of battle.  The war exposed Grant to the realities of military life and also marked the beginning of his deep dissatisfaction with certain aspects of army life and his political views. His experiences further cemented his relationship with Julia Dent, with whom he corresponded frequently.

## Life After the Mexican-American War and the Rise of Sectionalism

After the war, Grant resigned his commission, unable to support his growing family on an army officer's salary.  He attempted farming near St. Louis, but failing health and financial difficulties led him to seek employment as a clerk in his father's store in Galena, Illinois.  His *Memoirs* document his growing awareness of the escalating tensions between the North and South over slavery, culminating in the election of Abraham Lincoln. He confesses to voting for James Buchanan in 1856, believing that a Democratic victory would postpone the inevitable conflict, a decision that reflects his pragmatic approach and his concerns about the potential for war. The period before the outbreak of the Civil War solidified his feelings of the division between the Northern and Southern states.

## The Civil War Begins: From Clerk to Colonel

The firing on Fort Sumter galvanized Grant into action, leading him to participate in organizing volunteer troops in Illinois and later accepting a commission as Colonel of the 21st Illinois Infantry, a regiment struggling with discipline problems that he swiftly addressed.  He recounts his unexpected appointment, highlighting the role of political connections and his own military experience in securing this position. Grant's early involvement in the war demonstrates both his sudden shift to ardent support for the Union and his effectiveness in leading and organizing troops.  His early experience in Missouri brought him into contact with prominent politicians and future generals, such as General John Pope and the future General F.P. Blair.

## Early Victories and Promotion

Grant rapidly ascended the ranks, quickly receiving a commission as Brigadier General and then, after the Union victory at Fort Donelson, Major General. He details the strategies employed during the capture of Forts Henry and Donelson, highlighting his emphasis on swift, decisive action and his willingness to take risks.  The text also notes the significant role played by the Union Navy in these victories. The successes at Forts Henry and Donelson are followed by a period of political maneuvering and criticism, with Grant temporarily relieved of his command due to misunderstandings and conflicting reports from his superiors.  However, he is soon reinstated, demonstrating the confidence placed in his military abilities.


## Shiloh and the Corinth Campaign

The Battle of Shiloh, a pivotal and bloody engagement, is described in detail, highlighting the intense fighting and the significant casualties on both sides. Grant admits to errors in judgment, such as the failure of reinforcements to arrive promptly, but also emphasizes the resilience and valor of the Union troops, particularly under the leadership of General Sherman.  He later notes the intense political debate surrounding Shiloh in the North. The campaign to capture Corinth follows, with Grant's assessment of Halleck's overly cautious strategy contrasting with his own preferred approach of aggressive, decisive action. The Union victory at Corinth brings temporary relief, but also signals the start of a period of defending newly acquired territory in the face of significant Confederate opposition.

## Vicksburg Campaign Begins

After Corinth, Grant shifts his focus to Vicksburg, a strategically vital Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River.  He begins with descriptions of the initial difficulties, including failed attempts to create canals and find passable waterways around Vicksburg's defenses.  He highlights the challenges posed by the high water and the dense swampy terrain, noting that "Marching across this country in the face of an enemy was impossible; navigating it proved equally impracticable." Grant emphasizes the importance of maintaining morale in his army and keeping the enemy guessing.

## Vicksburg Campaign: Land and Water Assault

This section details the series of maneuvers, including the daring run of gunboats past Vicksburg's batteries, which ultimately lead to the Union securing a foothold on the east side of the Mississippi River. He discusses his decision to abandon the strategy of relying on a distant supply base at Columbus, in favor of living off the land and utilizing captured supplies.  The battles of Port Gibson, Raymond, and Champion's Hill are recounted, revealing Grant's emphasis on strategic flanking maneuvers to defeat the enemy in detail. He openly criticizes the actions of General McClernand, highlighting a lack of coordination and strategic miscalculations. 

## The Siege and Fall of Vicksburg

The siege of Vicksburg, a protracted and ultimately successful operation, is described, along with the failed Union assaults and the eventual surrender of the city.  Grant demonstrates awareness of the psychological aspects of warfare, describing how he used intercepted messages to maintain pressure on Pemberton, and using various ploys to make Pemberton underestimate him.  The text also emphasizes the heavy losses on both sides and the intense labor of siege warfare, including the construction and use of mines under Confederate positions.  He discusses his decision to move into a regular siege rather than risk further assaults, concluding that it was the best way to minimize casualties.

## The Overland Campaign and the Fall of Richmond

This section details the beginning of Grant's Overland Campaign against Lee's Army of Northern Virginia.  The battles of the Wilderness, Spottsylvania, North Anna, and Cold Harbor are described, showcasing Grant's strategy of relentless pressure, even in the face of heavy losses. Grant candidly evaluates his own mistakes and the performance of various commanders, including his critical assessment of General Warren's indecisiveness.  He also details Sheridan's significant cavalry raids that severely disrupted Lee's supply lines. The constant fighting demonstrates Grant's strategy to gradually wear down the Confederate forces.


## The Fall of Petersburg and Richmond, and the Surrender at Appomattox

This section recounts Grant's successful strategy of shifting the Army of the Potomac south of the James River and focusing on Petersburg and Richmond.  The Battle of Five Forks, a decisive victory secured largely through Sheridan's initiative, is a central point of this chapter. Grant reflects on the psychological impact of the battles, showing how Union morale increased as they realized the war's conclusion was near.  He candidly evaluates the failures of Union commanders, especially Burnside's performance at the Battle of the Crater. He details the negotiations and terms of surrender with General Lee at Appomattox Court House, dispelling various myths surrounding that historic event.


## Final Campaigns and the End of the War

This final section encompasses the concluding military campaigns of the Civil War.  Grant describes Sherman's March to the Sea and his subsequent movement northward through the Carolinas, highlighting the strategic importance of this campaign in crippling the Confederate supply lines and demoralizing the Southern population. He notes the ongoing tension between Sherman and the War Department over the terms of Johnston's surrender.  Grant summarizes other campaigns—Canby's move on Mobile, Wilson's raid in Alabama, Stoneman's raid in the Carolinas, and Sheridan's operations in the Shenandoah Valley. He concludes by reflecting on the end of the war, the capture of Jefferson Davis, and the complex process of national reconciliation.


## Post-War Reflections

Grant concludes with reflections on the causes of the Civil War, emphasizing slavery as the primary factor.  He discusses the impact of the war on the nation, the development of a stronger sense of national unity, and the challenges of Reconstruction.  He also considers the international implications of the war, referencing the interventions of European powers in Mexico and the strained relationship between the United States and Great Britain.  The text concludes with a forward-looking perspective, expressing optimism for peace and harmony between the North and South while acknowledging the need for national preparedness to maintain peace.  He also mentions his support for the annexation of Santo Domingo and his vision of the nation's future.
