### The Dawn of Prehistoric Egypt (Pre-5000 BCE)

The book opens by revolutionizing the understanding of early Egypt.  Previously, history began with the pyramid builders of the 4th Dynasty.  However, recent discoveries reveal a much older prehistoric Egypt.  The absence of prehistoric artifacts in the Nile Delta, similar to the alluvial plains of Mesopotamia, is attributed to the destructive effects of water and flooding. In contrast, the arid conditions of Upper Egypt preserved Paleolithic and Neolithic remains remarkably well.  The authors discuss the find of Paleolithic implements on Theban hills,  pointing out the debate between theories positing a forested plateau versus the more likely scenario of desert conditions throughout this period. Examples like the pear-shaped St. Acheul flints and half-moon shaped tools highlight the sophisticated flint-knapping techniques of prehistoric Egyptians.  The authors emphasize the importance of "sequence-dating," a system developed by Flinders Petrie, using pottery styles (like black-topped red ware and buff ware with red designs) to establish relative chronology.  While acknowledging limitations in this approach, they celebrate the work of  J. de Morgan in scientifically establishing the existence of a prehistoric Egyptian Stone Age.


### The Neolithic and Chalcolithic Transition (5000-4000 BCE)

The late Neolithic period in Egypt shows a high level of craftsmanship in pottery, bone carvings, and ivory work.  The authors note the transition to the Chalcolithic period, marked by the increasing use of copper alongside stone tools.  The exquisite flint knives, sometimes with gold handles, exemplify the peak of flint-knapping artistry.  The book highlights the importance of  M. de Morgan’s work in identifying and classifying numerous prehistoric cemeteries, stretching from Kawâmil to Edfu, containing simple burials with characteristic pottery, flint tools, and cosmetic palettes. The authors contrast de Morgan's work with that of Petrie and Quibell, who initially misidentified the "Nagada culture" as a later Libyan invasion, an error subsequently acknowledged by Quibell and Petrie. The el-'Amra excavations by Randall-Maclver and Wilkin are featured, showcasing the development of burial practices from simple pot burials to more elaborate brick tombs, a precursor to the tombs of the 1st Dynasty.


### The Unification of Egypt and the First Dynasty (c. 3100 BCE)

The book moves into the dynastic era, challenging the traditional view of the first three dynasties.  Archaeological findings at Abydos, first explored by Amélineau and later by Petrie and Mace, reveal the tombs of early kings, providing previously unknown names and correcting earlier inaccuracies in king lists. While acknowledging uncertainties regarding the exact location of the earliest kings’ burials, the authors highlight the tombs at Umm el-Ga’ab, emphasizing the discovery of secondary tombs, with artifacts indicating royal commemoration at Abydos rather than primary burial.  The discovery of Aha’s tomb at Nakâda is contrasted with the Abydos tombs. The significance of finding objects of kings like Den, Semti, Merpeba, and Khâsekhemui within these Abydos tombs is discussed, along with the evidence of ritually killed servants buried around the royal chambers. The authors quote Petrie's interpretation of tablets documenting events of kings like Semti's reign, highlighting the annual records of religious activities and military campaigns against the Northerners.  


### The Abydos Royal Tombs and the Nature of Death (c. 3100-2800 BCE)

The book deepens the analysis of the Abydos tombs, illustrating the primitive Egyptian concept of the afterlife. The practice of burying slaves with the kings exemplifies the naive understanding of death as a transition, not an ending.  The tombs’ rich contents—vases, food, tools, and personal effects—are interpreted as provisions for the royal ghost’s continued existence in the underworld, a network of interconnected tombs.  The authors note the shift from contracted burials (in the Neolithic period) to extended burials with mummification (in the early dynastic era), suggesting a cultural shift brought about by a conquering race. The importance of the Abydos necropolis as the ultimate destination is highlighted, with the construction of secondary tombs at Abydos emphasizing the importance of this location, even for rulers buried elsewhere.


### Memphis and the Rise of the Pyramid Builders (c. 3000-2600 BCE)

The foundation of Memphis is discussed, challenging the traditional attribution to Mena. The authors propose that Merpeba, a king whose identity is definitively established by matching his name on artifacts and in the king-lists, may have actually founded Memphis. The merging of the earlier indigenous Phtah cult with the southern cult of Seker (later conflated with Osiris) in the Memphite necropolis is examined. The book details the evolution of royal tombs from simple brick mastabas (Aha at Nakâda) to more elaborate brick tombs (Abydos) and finally to the pyramids of the Old Kingdom. The text outlines Lepsius' and Petrie's differing theories on pyramid construction, ultimately favoring Borchardt's synthesis: long-lived kings sometimes expanded their pyramids over time, as exemplified by the Great Pyramid of Giza.


### The Iron Age Debate and Pyramid Construction (c. 2700-2200 BCE)

The discovery of iron fragments in the Great Pyramid and later at Abydos is discussed, resolving the long-standing debate about the early use of iron in Egypt.  The authors refute Prof. Montelius's claim that the early presence of iron in Egypt was unlikely, stressing that human cultural development is not uniformly linear like natural evolution.  The book highlights the significance of the iron fragments, establishing the early knowledge of iron in Egypt, contradicting earlier views that placed its introduction much later.  M. Legrain’s interpretation of Herodotus’s description of pyramid construction is examined, suggesting the use of simple wooden machines and massive earthen ramps, a method that has been revived in modern times.  The exploration of pyramids of the Middle Kingdom at Dashûr, Lisht, and Illahun is summarized, showcasing the lavish jewelry and artifacts found in accompanying tombs.


### The Labyrinth and Early Minoan Connections (c. 2050-1650 BCE)

The discussion shifts to the pyramid of Amenemhat III at Hawara and its associated massive temple, identified as the Labyrinth of Greek accounts.  The authors analyze the etymology of the word “labyrinth,” arguing for a pre-Hellenic origin, dismissing earlier attempts to link it to an Egyptian root.  The Hawara temple’s similarities to the Minoan palace at Knossos are noted. They highlight the growing evidence for contact between Egypt and Crete, predating the 18th Dynasty. The discovery of early Minoan pottery at Illahun alongside 12th Dynasty artifacts indicates early communication and cultural exchange between Egypt and Crete, which is discussed further in the context of the Keftiu depictions in Theban tombs.


### The Hyksos and the Rise of Thebes (c. 1650 BCE)

The book revisits the Hyksos invasion, rejecting theories linking them to Mongols or Hittites.  The authors argue for an Arab origin based on their name and the prevailing Semitic character of their names. The potential connection between the Hyksos conquest of Egypt and a contemporaneous Arab incursion into Babylonia is explored. The Theban resistance to the Hyksos and the subsequent unification of Egypt under the 18th Dynasty are outlined.  The authors highlight the significant cultural changes that occurred, including the adoption of horse-drawn chariots and increased contact with Western Asia, marking a major turning point in Egyptian history.


### Theban Temples and Tombs of the New Kingdom (c. 1550-1070 BCE)

The book delves into the archaeology of Thebes, starting with Mr. Newberry's discovery of early Theban tombs of the 6th Dynasty. The excavations of the XIth Dynasty temple at Dêr el-Bahari by Naville and Hall are described in detail, revealing a pyramid-tomb complex that influenced Hatshepsu's later temple.  The authors highlight the discovery of the tomb of Neb-hapet-Râ Mentuhetep and the accompanying burials of royal women, possibly ritually killed, alongside _ushabti_ figures.  The unique artistic style of the XIth Dynasty reliefs, attributed to the artists Mertisen and his son, is discussed, emphasizing its transitional nature between the Old and Middle Kingdoms.  The excavations of the XVIIIth Dynasty tombs of Shêkh ‘Abd el-Kûrna by Newberry and Mond are highlighted, showcasing depictions of daily life and the arrival of Keftiu tribute-bearers.  The discovery and exploration of the tombs of Amenhetep II and Thothmes IV, revealing well-preserved mummies and rich funerary objects, are described, and the discussion is then extended to the tomb of Iuaa and Tuaa.


### The Late Period: Archaism and Foreign Influence (c. 712 BCE - 30 BCE)

The book concludes with a discussion of the Late Period of ancient Egypt, characterized by a revival of earlier artistic styles and a waning of imperial power. The reign of Amasis, and the battle of Momemphis, is highlighted, emphasizing the humane treatment of the defeated rival Apries, contrasting with the brutality of other ancient empires. This is done with the inclusion of a relevant quote from the text which is “ his Majesty himself buried him (Apries), in order to establish him as a king possessing virtue, for his Majesty decreed that the hatred of the gods should be removed from him.” The exploration of Naukratis by Hogarth is summarized, correcting errors in earlier assessments by Petrie and revealing an older Egyptian town beneath the Greek settlement.  The Ptolemaic period is discussed, showing the adoption of imperial trappings and the resulting archaistic revival, even including the misidentification of the Keftiu with Phoenicians, which is then contrasted with the more accurate understanding developed from more recent Cretan discoveries. The work concludes with a discussion of the Nubian kingdom, the excavations at Jebel Barkal and Meroë, the Christian kingdom of Alwa, and the last remnants of Egyptian influence in the Coptic churches of the Sudan, ending with a summation of the work at Bawit.
