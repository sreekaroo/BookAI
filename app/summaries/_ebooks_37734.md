# Some Jewish Witnesses for Christ: A Chronological Summary

Here's a chronological summary of the provided text, exceeding 10% of its original length, formatted in markdown:

**I. Apostolic Era: A Foundation of Jewish Believers**

The book begins by establishing the historical presence of Jewish converts within the early Christian church, noting that many early disciples, though using Hellenistic names, were Jewish.  The text highlights the lack of detailed information in the Acts of the Apostles regarding individual conversions,  despite St. James' mention of "many thousands of Jews...which believe" (Acts xxi. 20).  This absence of individual accounts is attributed to St. Luke's lack of focus on demonstrating the Gospel's power through mass Jewish conversion.  The text contrasts this with modern missionary historians like Pastor de le Roi, who meticulously document individual converts, emphasizing the importance of understanding the individuals behind the numbers. The scarcity of information is contrasted with the writings of Hegesippus, a Palestinian Hebrew Christian, whose lost work likely contained such details. However,  fragments of Hegesippus' work reveal a list of Hebrew Christian bishops in Jerusalem, including James, the Lord's brother, who was martyred in the Temple. The Talmud also provides brief positive references to Nicodemus ben Gorian and Jacob of Kefar Sakanya (Simai),  both acknowledged for their piety, even despite their Christian beliefs.

**II. Sub-Apostolic/Patristic Period: Notable Converts and Growing Tension**

This period introduces Epiphanius, a Palestinian Jew who became Bishop of Constantia and wrote on heretical sects, including Jewish ones.  Joseph, a physician and former Sanhedrin member, is described as enduring persecution before his conversion and subsequent elevation by Emperor Constantine.  The text notes Epiphanius’ claim that Hillel, a patriarch of Tiberias, secretly converted to Christianity on his deathbed, which is disputed by some Jewish historians, highlighting the difficulty in verifying historical accounts and the often conflicting perspectives on conversions. Other notable converts during this time include Tabius (high priestly descent), Asher ben Levi (killed by his father for converting), and Jacob of Kefar Neuburaya (who maintained some positive relationships with rabbis, even while identified as a Judeo-Christian).

**III. The Talmudic Period: Increasing Separation and Persecution**

The destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent flight of Jewish Christians to Pella led to increased animosity from Rabbinic Judaism.  The text points out that early interactions between Jewish Christians and Rabbinic Jews were occasionally amicable, as evidenced by stories in the Talmud suggesting gift-giving and even friendly discussions, with some Talmudic teachings possibly influenced by interaction with Jewish Christians.  However,  the completion of the Babylonian Talmud in the fifth century solidified the separation and increased hostility, creating an "iron partition" between the two groups.   The text illustrates this escalating tension with a legend concerning a Jewish glassblower's child, who was miraculously saved after being thrown into a furnace by his enraged father for attending church.  This highlights the severe consequences of embracing Christianity.

**IV.  Jewish Converts in the Eastern Church: A Diverse Group**

This section shifts the focus to conversions within the Eastern Church.  It highlights Aleksander Alekseyev, a Russian Jewish convert who converted hundreds of Jewish Cantonists (conscripted soldiers).  His life's work involved writing extensively on Jewish ethnography and missionary topics, including the refutation of blood libel accusations against Jews.   Gregory Bar-Hebræus, a Jacobite Syrian historian, physician, and theologian of Jewish descent, is also discussed.  He was a prolific writer who, while not fluent in Hebrew, had significant knowledge of Jewish thought and often cited Jewish sources in his works.  Finally, the text notes Anton and Nikolai Rubinstein, noted musicians who were children of Jewish converts to Orthodox Christianity.

**V. Jewish Converts in the Western Church (Pre-Reformation): A Complex Picture**

This section details conversions to Roman Catholicism, highlighting the Church’s zealous but often coercive missionary methods in Spain, which sometimes involved intrigue and eventually contributed to the Inquisition. The author emphasizes that despite the sometimes questionable methods, several converts demonstrated genuine faith through their achievements and works. Several pre-Reformation conversions are listed and include Abiathar ha Kohen Esther, Abner, Abraham Beneveniste and others, and discusses their personal circumstances and the details of their conversions and accomplishments. 

**VI. Jewish Converts in the Western Church (Post-Reformation): Voluntary Conversions**

The Reformation brought a new era of religious freedom, facilitating more voluntary conversions to Protestantism.  The list of converts continues, arranged alphabetically,  with many exhibiting significant contributions to various fields of knowledge.  The text notes the "Domus Conversorum," a home for converts in London during the Middle Ages, and lists several of its documented inhabitants.  This demonstrates the early English interest in Jewish conversions, although the scale of conversion remains uncertain.

**VII. Converts in Protestant Churches: Diverse Paths to Faith**

This section features numerous examples of Jewish converts to various Protestant denominations across Europe and America.   Abraham, a Rabbi who converted through interaction with Count Zinzendorf, exemplifies the personal faith and devotion often found in these accounts.

**VIII.  The Life of Michael Solomon Alexander: From Rabbi to Bishop**

The chapter details the life of Michael Solomon Alexander, a significant figure who became the first Anglican Bishop of Jerusalem.  The author recounts Alexander's journey from strict rabbinic Judaism to becoming a missionary, then Bishop, highlighting the significant impact of his conversion and the difficulties he faced, including opposition from his own family and community. Several excerpts from his letters and accounts of his life are included to illustrate his deep faith and devotion to his people.  His early death in 1845 is poignantly described, underscoring his dedication to his mission.

**IX.  Prominent Converts and Their Contributions: A Showcase of Talent**

This section presents detailed biographies of various significant converts, including the prolific writer and scholar, Joiachim Heinrich Biesenthal (who contributed greatly to Jewish and Christian scholarship), and Paulus Cassel, a noted scholar, politician, and missionary. It illustrates the diversity of intellectual and spiritual gifts within the community of Jewish converts. Examples of their writings and accomplishments are provided. 

**X.  More Converts and Their Journeys: Faith Amidst Persecution**

This section continues the presentation of individual biographies, highlighting the experiences, contributions, and personal struggles of various converts. Many biographical sketches illustrate the challenges faced by these individuals, including persecution from family and community, and the sacrifices they made in their faith. The accounts range from those who became missionaries to those who excelled in fields like medicine, law, or arts. 

**XI. The Legacy of Jewish Converts: A Continuing Witness**

The concluding paragraphs of the book emphasize the lasting impact and ongoing contribution of Jewish converts to both the Church and their own people. The author reinforces the idea that the accounts presented are representative of a much larger number of unnamed believers. The significance of these conversions lies not only in the personal testimonies but also in their wider impact on Jewish-Christian relations and the advancement of both faiths. The numerous biographical sketches illustrate the diverse backgrounds, journeys, and lasting contributions of these individuals.
