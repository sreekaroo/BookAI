### **I. Introducing the Psychology of Management**

Lillian Moller Gilbreth's "The Psychology of Management" isn't just about managing work; it's about the interplay between the directing mind and the worker's mind, and how this dynamic affects the work itself. Gilbreth highlights the then-novel idea of psychology's relevance to management, arguing that "every man going out into the world needs all the knowledge that he can get as to the working of the human mind in order not only to give but to receive information with the least waste and expenditure of energy." She emphasizes the crucial role of the human mind in achieving efficiency, a concept central to "Scientific Management."  The book aims to bridge psychology and management, not to provide an exhaustive treatment of either. Gilbreth outlines her unique approach: examining the underlying principles of Scientific Management through the lens of psychology, using three types of management (Traditional, Transitory, and Scientific) as a framework.

### **II. Defining Management: Traditional, Transitory, and Scientific**

Gilbreth distinguishes between three types of management.  Traditional management, she argues, is characterized by a single, all-around manager with a clear line of authority, often referred to as "Military," "Driver," or the "Marquis of Queensberry type," terms she finds less than ideal.  She prefers "Traditional" or "Initiative and Incentive Management," terms reflecting  Taylor's own descriptions.   The second type, "Transitory" management, represents a transitional phase where elements of Scientific Management are gradually incorporated.  Scientific, or "Ultimate," Management, the pinnacle, operates according to scientifically derived and measurable laws, primarily through time study's application, which "makes management become a science."  Gilbreth notes the confusion arising from using old terms for new concepts, a "powerful argument for the new science" yet a source of "endless confusion, unwarranted prejudice, and worse."

### **III. The Importance of Individuality in Management**

The book's second chapter explores individuality, defining it as a unique unit with special characteristics. Gilbreth contrasts the lack of individuality's recognition in Traditional Management, where worker selection was often arbitrary, output wasn't separately recorded, and individual tasks or teaching were rare, with the central role individuality plays in Scientific Management.  Under Traditional Management, selecting workers was often based on guesswork, not measurement, resulting in "waste of time on the work...waste of the worker, and many times a positive injury to the worker." Scientific Management, however, emphasizes the individual as the unit of measurement and utilizes specialized functions to cater to individual strengths, stating, "the man's mind is a controlling factor in his efficiency, and has, by teaching, enabled the man to make the most of his powers."

### **IV. Utilizing Individuality Through Functionalization**

Gilbreth meticulously defines functionalization as "the state of being divided into functions, or being functionalized," using the term "function" as psychologists do, emphasizing a specific way of acting. Traditional management lacked functionalization, overburdening foremen with diverse, often conflicting duties (a point she illustrates with lengthy lists of a foreman's requirements).  Gilbreth contrasts this with Scientific Management's functionalization, which separates planning from performing, and subdivides the foreman's role into specialized functions (Route Clerk, Instruction Card Clerk, Time and Cost Clerk, Disciplinarian, Gang Boss, Speed Boss, Repair Boss, Inspector), each with specific tasks.  This specialization promotes coöperation and allows for better utilization of individual skills: "the man with any special talent or talents, individuality or special fitness is much more likely...to obtain and retain the place that he is fitted for."

### **V. The Crucial Role of Measurement in Scientific Management**

Measurement is another key theme, pivotal to making management a science.  Gilbreth argues for the importance of measurement in both psychology and management, highlighting the use of precision instruments in experimental psychology to measure even minuscule time intervals. She notes that even the most advanced Traditional Management lacked accurate measurement of individual worker capacity and efficiency, relying instead on measuring results after the fact.  In contrast, Scientific Management utilizes motion study and time study to analyze work into elementary units, measure them, and synthesize methods of least waste.  She stresses that observation must be unbiased and involve the worker's full knowledge and cooperation, opposing secretive time studies as counterproductive and harmful.  The text explains, "the art of using them [measurements] consists largely in checks and counter checks, and in knowing how far the measurement is reliable and where the doubtful zone begins."

### **VI. Analysis, Synthesis, and the Development of the Task**

Analysis and synthesis are the methods used to determine standards in Scientific Management. The analyst breaks down work into the most fundamental elements, considering factors like cost, repetition, and availability of trained personnel. The synthesist then combines the most efficient elements into a standard, forming the basis for the "Task."  Gilbreth discusses the word "Task," acknowledging the negative connotations associated with the term but justifying its continued use due to its established place in Scientific Management. The "Task," under Scientific Management, is carefully defined as a standard amount of work achievable by a first-class man while thriving, including work time, rest time, and allowances for delays.  She emphasizes the Task's achievable nature and the necessity of  "a definite and sufficient percentage of allowance for overcoming fatigue."

### **VII. Standardization: Creating and Implementing Standards**

This chapter centers on standardization, the process of establishing and maintaining models for work processes, tools, and environments.  Gilbreth notes that while traditional management attempted some standardization, it lacked the scientific rigor of Scientific Management.  Under Traditional Management, standardization was often arbitrary, based on observation of successful practices without detailed analysis. Transitory management sees a growing appreciation of standardization, leading to the development of written systems.  Scientific Management elevates standardization to a science, deriving standards from measured elements and providing that they are "used until a more perfect standard displaces it." She compares this continuous improvement process to the ongoing effort of the Simplified Spelling Board.  She emphasizes the standardization of tools, equipment, working conditions (including clothing), and a standard "method of attack" aiming to minimize wasted effort, creating, "a permanently existing 'Idea' which makes its appearance before the footlights of consciousness at periodic intervals...a mythological entity."

### **VIII. Records and Programmes: The Foundation of Predictability**

Records and programmes are closely linked and essential to Scientific Management.  Traditional management had few detailed written records, hindering systematic planning and improvement.  In contrast, Scientific Management uses detailed, written records of work and worker efficiency, allowing for accurate predictions.  Gilbreth emphasizes that records should directly reduce costs and simplify work, utilizing the "exception principle" for efficient management oversight. She presents Table I and II to illustrate the various possible combinations of conscious and unconscious records and programmes, highlighting the complexity of these interrelations.  The key outcome is that accurate records enable the creation of reliable programmes, turning the calendar into a predictable map of future operations.  "The calendar, or chronological chart, becomes a true prophecy of what will take place."


### **IX. The Essential Role of Teaching in Scientific Management**

Teaching is arguably the most important aspect of Scientific Management. Traditional management's teaching was haphazard, lacking in standardization, and with little incentive for the teachers (experienced workers) to impart knowledge. Scientific Management, however, systematically integrates teaching into the management structure, with functional foremen as specialized instructors supplementing written instructions (instruction cards, systems, drawings, photographs).  Gilbreth details the various methods of teaching—written and oral, including demonstrations and object lessons—and stresses the psychological principles underlying effective instruction.  The instruction cards, meticulously detailed, aim to create efficient habits, starting with "right motions first," then speed, and finally quality. "The great thing, then, in all education, is to make our nervous system our ally instead of an enemy," Gilbreth quotes James, highlighting the value of habit formation.

### **X. Incentives and Welfare: Achieving Coöperation and Thriving**

Incentives are crucial in motivating workers. While Traditional Management relied on often arbitrary rewards and punishments, Scientific Management uses scientifically derived incentives, designed to increase output and worker satisfaction. Gilbreth compares and contrasts various incentive systems: day work (which she criticizes as lacking sufficient incentive), piecework (with the danger of rate cutting), gain-sharing, the premium plan, profit-sharing, and task-based systems (Differential Rate Piecework, Task Work with a Bonus, Differential Bonus, Three Rate with Increased Rate).  Welfare, under Scientific Management, isn't a separate department but rather an integral part of the system itself.  It encompasses physical improvement (through regular work, good habits, and physical development), mental development (habits of attention and a method of attack), and moral development (personal responsibility, responsibility for others, self-control, and fairness). "The ultimate result of all this physical improvement, mental development and moral development is increased capacity, increased capacity not only for work, but for health, and for life in general."  She concludes by advocating for the complete integration of welfare into Scientific Management, eliminating any sense of charity and fostering genuine cooperation between management and workers.
