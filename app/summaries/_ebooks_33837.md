# Architecture: Gothic and Renaissance - A Chronological Summary

This summary organizes the provided text chronologically, offering detailed insights into the evolution of Gothic and Renaissance architecture.

## Anglo-Saxon and Norman Foundations (Pre-1189)

The book begins by establishing the architectural context preceding the Gothic style.  It likens the evolution of architecture to that of language, with the Anglo-Saxon period (pre-1066) representing "rude work and rough material; walls mostly of rubble or ragstone with ashlar at the angles in long and short courses alternately; openings with round or triangular heads, sometimes divided by a rude baluster." The Norman period (1066-1189) saw an advancement, featuring "semicircular arches, occasionally stilted; at first plain, afterwards enriched with chevron or other mouldings; and frequent repetition of same ornament on each stone."  Examples like the Keep and Chapel of the Tower of London illustrate this era's characteristics.  The transition to Gothic commenced toward the end of the Norman period with features like "pointed arch with Norman pier" and "Norman abacus blended with Early English foliage in capitals," clearly demonstrating a stylistic shift.

## The Rise of Early English Gothic (1189-1307)

The Early English period (1189-1307) is characterized by "more slender proportions, and height of walls, columns, &c., greater. Arches pointed, generally lancet; often richly moulded." The distinctive lancet windows ("resembling the point of a lancet in outline") became a defining feature of this style. The text highlights Westminster Abbey's choir and Chapter House as examples of "advanced Early English," showcasing features like "exquisite examples of E. E. window-tracery."  The use of clustered shafts ("composed of a central circular shaft surrounded by several smaller ones") in piers also emerged during this period.

## Decorated Gothic Flourishes (1307-1377)

The Decorated period (1307-1377) witnessed a surge in ornamentation, as reflected in its name.  The style shifted towards "less lofty proportions" than the Early English period, and arches typically "inclosing an equilateral angle," were employed.  Windows became "large, and divided into two or more lights by mullions," featuring increasingly complex tracery.   The text differentiates between the "geometrical" (early Decorated) and "flowing" (late Decorated) styles of tracery, illustrating the evolving sophistication of window design. The choir of Westminster Abbey is cited as an example, although influenced by the preceding phase.  The "ball flower" ornament is also noted as characteristic of this era.


## Perpendicular Gothic and the Tudor Era (1377-1546)

The Perpendicular period (1377-1546) is identified by the prominent use of "perpendicular lines, both in general features and in ornaments," especially in window tracery and wall panelling. The "depressed four-centered arch," also known as the Tudor arch, became prevalent, marking a shift towards more obtuse angles.  Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster is presented as the epitome of this style, with its distinctive "fan-tracery vault" and profuse panelling. The author notes a decline in the artistic quality of mouldings, describing them as "large, coarse, and with wide and shallow hollows and hard wiry edges, meagre in appearance and wanting in minute and delicate detail."

## French Gothic Architecture (12th-15th Centuries)

The text then shifts to a discussion of French Gothic, highlighting regional variations stemming from the country's decentralized political structure.  The author contrasts the relative uniformity of English Norman architecture with the diverse regional styles of France, mentioning the "Romance provinces" and their slower adoption of pointed architecture.  The author notes that the "transitional architecture of France" often combined "pointed arch employed for the most important parts of the structure, while the round arch is still retained in the window and door-heads, and in decorative arcades."  The First Pointed style (13th century) is exemplified by Notre Dame in Paris, emphasizing its "air of breadth and dignity" resulting from "simple details, noble proportions, and great size."  The Second and Third Pointed styles (14th and 15th centuries) show a closer resemblance to their English counterparts, with increasing ornamentation and the emergence of the flamboyant style in the 15th century.  The author emphasizes the magnificence of French portals, contrasting them with the emphasis on windows in English Gothic.

## Gothic in Belgium, Netherlands, and the British Isles

The book proceeds to explore Gothic architecture in Belgium and the Netherlands, noting its strong French influence and the excellence of civic buildings like town halls.  The text highlights the "Town Halls of Brussels, Louvain, Bruges, Mechlin, Ghent, Oudenarde, and Ypres" as examples of rich, late Gothic style.  In the British Isles (Scotland, Wales, and Ireland), the architectural styles demonstrate a mixture of local adaptations and influences from England and France.  The text mentions Scottish examples such as Glasgow Cathedral and Melrose Abbey, contrasting them with the later, less English styles of buildings like Roslyn Chapel.  In Wales, the focus is on the castles built during the reign of Edward I, displaying fine English Gothic characteristics.  Ireland is noted for its Romanesque buildings, but with the mention of some Gothic monastic buildings.

## Central and Northern European Gothic (12th-16th Centuries)

The architectural styles of Germany and other Northern European countries are detailed next, with the observation that early German Gothic (12th-13th centuries) represented a more elaborate form of Romanesque ("fully developed Romanesque" or "round-arched Gothic") than that seen in England or France.  Cologne Cathedral is presented as a masterpiece of German Gothic, built in a style that largely resembles French examples from the same period.  The text notes peculiarities of German church plans, including the occasional use of apses at both the east and west ends.  The book highlights the prominence of towers and spires in Germany, with examples from Cologne, Strasburg, and Friburg Cathedrals illustrating the intricacy of open tracery spires.  Later German Gothic features are characterized by "exuberant fancy" and a tendency towards "artificial difficulties" in design.  The author discusses the late style’s "interpenetration" of mouldings as a peculiar decorative feature.

## Italian Gothic: A Regional Approach (13th-15th Centuries)

Italian Gothic architecture is discussed as a foreign import, with regional variations.  Northern Italy's Gothic style is linked to German influence, with the use of brickwork prevalent in the region.  The Certosa near Pavia, with its intricate terra-cotta ornamentation, is noted for its unique blend of Gothic and Italian elements.  Milan Cathedral, despite its Renaissance façade, stands as the region’s premier example of Gothic, characterized by its "vast extent" and rich marble decoration. Venice stands out for its Gothic palaces along the Grand Canal, characterized by their distinctive window arrangements. Central Italy's Gothic is described as more elaborate than Northern Italy's, with Florence, Siena, and Orvieto Cathedrals offering notable examples.  The author highlights the influence of architects and sculptors such as the Pisani family and Giotto, alongside other features like the use of coloured marbles and the prominence of campaniles. Southern Italy and Sicily are noted for their unique blend of Byzantine, Saracenic, and Norman influences, showcasing examples such as the cathedral of Monreale.

## The Italian Renaissance Begins (Mid-15th Century Onward)

The text then turns to the Italian Renaissance, highlighting its origins in Florence and the pivotal role of Brunelleschi and Alberti in establishing the style.  The book describes Santo Spirito and the Ruccellai Palace as examples of early Renaissance architecture in Florence, emphasizing their "refined taste," "delicate and refined detail," and subtle ornamentation.  The rise of more elaborate styles later in the period is attributed to the influence of Michelangelo and other prominent figures.  Rome is discussed as the center of the High Renaissance, with St. Peter's Basilica as its crowning achievement, noting the contributions of Bramante, Michelangelo, and later architects. The text emphasizes the shift towards "grander," bolder designs and increased use of classic orders.

## Renaissance in France and Northern Europe

The spread of the Renaissance to France, Germany, and other Northern European countries is presented as a process involving a period of transition and adaptation.  The French style of Francis I (1515-1547) is highlighted for its elegant blend of Gothic and Renaissance elements, exemplifying "a fineness of detail and a smallness of scale" different from Italian work.  The châteaux of Chambord and Blois are cited as prime examples, showcasing the picturesque quality of this transitional style.  Later French Renaissance architecture is described as aligning more closely with the designs of Vignola, featuring a more ordered use of classic orders.  The evolution of the Louvre and the Tuileries Palace are discussed, showcasing the French adaptations of Renaissance details.  The text also observes a decline in quality towards the end of the 17th and into the 18th centuries, but notes exceptions like the Hôtel des Invalides and the Pantheon, both displaying skillful use of the dome.  Germany and Northern Europe's Renaissance is detailed as a slower adaptation than that seen in France or Italy, with much of the work retaining a picturesque quality, combining Gothic and classic elements.  Examples include Heidelberg Castle and various town halls.  The style is ultimately described as becoming rather tame and uninspired in later years.

## Renaissance in Great Britain, Spain, and Portugal

The chapter concludes with a detailed account of the Renaissance in Great Britain, starting with the transitional Elizabethan style (post-1558). The author distinguishes this style from the earlier Tudor and describes the hall, the large windows, and the use of mullions and transoms as important features.  The contributions of Inigo Jones and Christopher Wren are prominently featured; Wren's St. Paul's Cathedral, along with his churches and other buildings, is presented as a significant accomplishment of English Renaissance architecture. The styles of later British architects, such as Vanbrugh, Campbell, Gibbs, Kent, and the Adams, are touched on, along with the emergence of the Queen Anne style. In Spain, the Plateresco style, characterized by a mix of Gothic and Renaissance elements and ornate decoration, is discussed, along with the later, more austere style of Juan de Herrera, exemplified by the Escorial Palace.  The later, flamboyant Churrigueresque style is also mentioned.  Finally, the Renaissance architecture of Portugal is mentioned, with the Convent at Mafra as a notable, though late, example.
