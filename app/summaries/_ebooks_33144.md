# The Oriental Rug: A Chronological Summary

## I. The Enigmatic Allure of Oriental Rugs

The author, W.D. Ellwanger, opens by highlighting the paradoxical nature of Oriental rugs.  Viewed superficially, they appear as "rude and awkward figures in crude colours," yet a deeper appreciation reveals "the richest and softest of colours, the most harmonious shadings and blendings."  This inherent mystery, coupled with the lack of definitive expertise and scholarly literature, forms the core of the rug's appeal. The author points out the scarcity of reliable experts, contrasting the readily available knowledge about Old Masters' paintings with the near-total absence of clear provenance for most rugs.  He laments the near-extinction of truly antique, high-quality rugs in the market, noting that even major importers were finding few valuable antique pieces by 1902. The very names "Persian" and "Oriental" themselves evoke the romance and mystique surrounding these woven treasures.


## II. A Complex Taxonomy of Rugs

Ellwanger emphasizes the importance of understanding the classification of Oriental rugs.  The names themselves, often derived from their places of origin, are numerous and inconsistently spelled, requiring careful phonetic and conventional understanding. He cleverly compares mastering rug nomenclature to appreciating the nuances of roses or laces, emphasizing that a familiarity with these names enhances enjoyment and understanding.  He provides a general classification, separating rugs by their region of origin (Persia, Turkey, Caucasia, Turkestan, Afghanistan, Beluchistan, and India).  Within each region, specific types of rugs are listed, highlighting the prestigious Persian varieties (Kirman, Sehna, Kurdistan, Khorassan, etc.) and the notable Turkish types (Gheordez, Koulah, Koniahs, Ladiks, etc.).


## III. The Art of Rug Making: A Labor of Love

The process of rug making is described as simple yet painstaking. The warp is stretched on a frame, and the weaver meticulously knots woollen yarn onto the warp, row by row.  The number of knots per square inch varies greatly, indicating quality, with fine rugs boasting hundreds or even thousands of knots. Ellwanger notes that the designs and colour schemes were largely memorized by the weavers, with few patterns to follow; each weaver generally adhering to the style of their region.  He touches upon the traditional role of women in rug weaving, particularly in relation to bridal dowries, viewing the rugs as "a work of love and often a work of years."  The rugs represented a significant investment of time and effort for both weavers and those commissioning their creation.


## IV. Designs, Borders, and the Quest for Identity

The designs themselves, originally acting as regional trademarks, became more fluid over time. This diffusion led to rugs bearing designs that sometimes contradict their place of origin.  Ellwanger, however, emphasizes the importance of borders as a key to identification, stating that "borders are often truer and safer guides to classification than are the designs of centre or field."  He highlights specific examples like the Serabend border, the Persian border, Feraghan leaf design, and the Rhodian border, emphasizing their distinctive characteristics.  He also delves into the symbolism embedded in seemingly simple patterns, noting the potential origin of designs like crab, turtle, and lobster borders in the dyes derived from marine and insect life.


## V. The Significance of Dyes: Vegetable Versus Mineral

The author stresses the crucial role of dyes in determining a rug's quality and value.  He contrasts the beauty and durability of vegetable dyes, derived from plants, roots, and insects, with the inferior and fast-fading aniline dyes, highlighting the detrimental effects of mineral dyes on some rugs.  He mentions a specific test used by an Armenian expert, involving tasting the wool to detect mineral dyes. The text mentions the use of mineral dyes for certain colours such as black and brown, particularly in Turkish rugs, and green in some Persian rugs, noting how these often degraded over time.  The unpredictable fading of vegetable dyes is also contrasted with the more harsh decay of modern synthetic colors.


## VI. A Closer Look at Persian Rugs

Ellwanger dedicates a chapter to Persian rugs, which he considers the finest.  He criticizes the misuse of the term "antique," emphasizing that age alone does not determine value.  He singles out Kirman rugs as the most coveted but cautions against fakes prevalent in the market, commenting that most marketed "Kirmans" are produced en masse and are chemically treated to mimic age. Sehna rugs are noted for their "frosted velvet" texture and intricate designs, while Khorassans are praised for their softness.  He describes the distinctive design elements of Serabends (multiple diamond patterns and palm-leaf figures), Shiraz rugs (often crooked and featuring "shawl patterns"), Youraghans and Joshghans, and Feraghans (crescent-shaped, toothed figures, resembling curled rose leaves). Mousul rugs, owing to their mixed Persian-Turkish origin, display characteristics of both, and are praised for their lustrous and silky quality.


## VII. The Diverse World of Caucasian and Russian Rugs

Caucasian rugs, particularly those from Daghestan, are discussed next.  Ellwanger emphasizes the Persian influence evident in their designs while highlighting their distinctive use of geometric figures, angles, and mosaics.  He notes the confusion surrounding the term "Daghestan," historically used indiscriminately for a variety of Caucasian rugs, and differentiates between true Daghestan types (Shirvans, Kabistans, Chichis, Darbends, Karabaghs) and the more robust Russian types (Yourucks and Kazaks).  He praises the finer characteristics of Shirvans, Chichis, and Kabistans, contrasting them with the cheaper, mass-produced versions commonly found in the market.  Kazaks are described as strong and durable, with bold and sometimes crude designs.


## VIII. Turkoman and Turkestan Rugs: A Journey Eastward

The discussion then shifts to Turkoman and Turkestan rugs, a journey eastward through Afghanistan and Beluchistan.  Bokhara rugs, though familiar in design, are praised for their rich variations in colour and their often superb quality.  However, the author warns about chemically treated fakes imitating rare old Bokharas.  He discusses Yamoud-Bokharas (larger, bolder designs and use of green and yellow), Afghans (coarser than Bokharas), and Beluchistans (often displaying dark, rich colours and a unique velvety sheen).  The author particularly emphasizes the elaborate selvedge of Beluchistan rugs, suggesting trimming them down for better overall aesthetic balance.  Soumac (or Cashmere) rugs and Killims are also briefly mentioned.


## IX. Beyond Rugs: Carpets, Saddlebags, and Pillows

Ellwanger addresses carpets, acknowledging their primarily utilitarian role, but still highlighting the beauty of certain modern types (Kirmanshahs, Tabriz, Kurdistan, and Gorovans).  He then moves to a discussion of saddlebags and pillows, noting that these smaller pieces often contain some of the most valuable and interesting examples of Oriental weaving.  He describes various sizes and types of saddlebags, from small donkey bags to larger camel bags, and notes that the purpose of a piece (saddlebag or pillow) can sometimes be discerned by examining the direction of the warp.  He specifically highlights the exquisite small Sehna rugs used as pillows and the Anatolian mats also employed for this purpose.  The chapter also mentions saddle cloths as another noteworthy category of smaller-scale rugs.


## X. The World of Rug Auctions and Dealers

The final chapters deal with the commerce of rugs, discussing the role of auctions, auctioneers, and dealers.  The author presents arguments for auctions as a fair method of pricing rugs, emphasizing the role of individual preference in determining a rug's value beyond its intrinsic worth.  He observes on the auctioneer's skill in gauging the audience and manipulating bidding.  He then discusses the predominant role of Armenian dealers in the American rug market, contrasting their expertise with the growing influence of department stores.  Finally, he touches upon the difficulties in obtaining accurate statistics on rug imports due to the lack of specific classification in import records.  The conclusion emphasizes the arduous process of rug acquisition, highlighting the effort required to uncover new sources of supply, the importance of careful examination of potential purchases to avoid fakes and damage, and the need for proper care and cleaning of these valuable textiles.
