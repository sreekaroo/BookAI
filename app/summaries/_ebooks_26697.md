# Principles of Mining: A Summary

This summary condenses Herbert Hoover's *Principles of Mining: Valuation, Organization, and Administration*, offering a chronological overview of his key arguments and examples.

## I. Mine Valuation: A Foundation of Uncertainty

Hoover begins by emphasizing the inherent uncertainty in mine valuation.  He states, "It is utterly impossible to accurately value any mine, owing to the many speculative factors involved," highlighting the limitations of relying solely on readily available data.  He identifies four primary value components: positive value (profit from exposed ore), speculative values (future ore extension and fluctuating metal prices), management efficiency, and the crucial consideration of the mine's limited lifespan, which mandates a non-simple interest approach to valuation.   The book establishes the importance of understanding these factors not just for transactions but for ongoing management decisions and reporting to stakeholders.

## II. Determining Average Metal Content: Sampling and Assaying

Hoover dedicates significant attention to the process of determining average metal content, prioritizing the rigorous method of sampling over historical yield data or expensive test-treatment runs.  He stresses the critical need for meticulous sampling techniques under the personal supervision of the examining engineer to prevent fraud: "Ten samples properly taken are more valuable than five hundred slovenly ones."  His detailed procedures include trenching, crushing, quartering, and the avoidance of "grab samples." The text delves into the intricacies of assay plans, which graphically represent sample locations and values, crucial for estimating ore quantities.

## III. Calculating Ore Quantities and Classification

Hoover explains the calculation of ore quantities by dividing the mine into blocks and applying geometric approximations to estimate their volumes.   He cautions against mathematical over-refinement, acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in estimating specific gravity and porosity of ore. He provides a table of weights per cubic foot for various minerals to aid in approximate calculations, while recommending a "margin of safety" of 10-25% to account for unknowns.  The chapter then addresses the classification of ore reserves, criticizing the ambiguous terms "ore in sight" and "profit in sight," proposing instead a more rigorous system based on the probability of value extension from sampled faces.

## IV. Prospective Value:  Geological Speculation

Hoover confronts the challenge of assessing "prospective value" (or "extension in depth"), which represents the potential profit from ore beyond the currently exposed areas. He rejects simplistic methods of assigning a fixed percentage to the "profit in sight" as a means of evaluating the speculative ore. Instead, he advocates a nuanced geological approach, considering the origin and structure of the deposit, the impact of secondary enrichment, the development of neighboring mines, and the historical depth of exhaustion in similar deposits in the region.

## V. Recoverable Value, Metal Prices, and Production Costs

This section integrates the assay values with the realities of ore processing and market conditions. Hoover emphasizes determining the "recoverable percentage of the gross assay value," considering factors like metallurgical losses and smelter deductions. He then turns to the uncertainty of metal prices, distinguishing between "basic" and "normal" prices and providing estimated ranges for various metals (lead, zinc, copper, tin, and silver), acknowledging the cyclical nature of commodity markets. Finally, he discusses production costs, emphasizing the importance of calculating costs "per unit" of finished metal to readily assess the impact of fluctuating metal prices.

## VI. Amortization and Investment Risk

Hoover introduces the concept of amortization, a crucial factor in mine valuation due to the limited lifespan of mining operations. He explains the calculation of annual installments to redeem capital over time, incorporating compound interest to account for the value of earlier capital recovery. He demonstrates how this principle can be used in reverse to determine the minimum life (in years, tons of ore, or depth of extension) required to justify the purchase price of a mine at a given rate of return, allowing the investor to weigh this against geological and market probabilities.

## VII. Development Strategies: Entry Methods

Hoover shifts focus to mine development, examining the choices for mine entry: tunnels, vertical shafts, inclined shafts, and combined shafts. The optimal method depends on numerous factors such as the ore deposit's dip, anticipated output, depth, property boundaries, topography, and costs.  He presents various scenarios, outlining the engineering trade-offs for each option. Hoover specifically addresses "deep-level projects," where ore bodies must be accessed at depth from existing or adjacent mines, requiring careful consideration of cost versus production timelines.

## VIII. Shaft Design, Sinking Speed, and Tunnels

This chapter details the design and engineering of shafts. Hoover discusses the comparative merits of round versus rectangular shafts, arguing that rectangular timbered shafts are generally more economical for metal mines, providing designs illustrating various compartment arrangements optimized for efficiency.  The text addresses shaft size in relation to output, haulage equipment (skips versus cages), and depth, with recommendations for expansion to accommodate increasing tonnage.  Hoover also explores factors affecting shaft sinking speed and discusses the use of tunnels as an alternative entry method.

## IX. Subsidiary Development and Prospecting

Hoover moves on to subsidiary developments like stations, crosscuts, and levels, emphasizing the need to minimize unnecessary construction while maximizing efficiency.  He analyzes the factors influencing the vertical interval between levels, including ore regularity, stoping methods, and the need for sufficient access points to maintain output. He addresses various approaches for supporting mine workings and describes the construction of winzes and rises to connect different levels. The chapter also discusses the role of drilling (churn and diamond) in prospecting, especially in deep-level projects, acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in interpreting drill results.

## X. Stoping Methods and Ore Valuation During Extraction

This section centers on stoping—the process of extracting ore. Hoover classifies stoping methods as underhand, overhand, and combined, explaining their respective applications based on ore dip, wall stability, and cost considerations. He compares methods of supporting excavations (timbering, filling with waste, filling with broken ore, ore pillars, artificial pillars, and caving), analyzing the suitability of each approach under various conditions and highlighting the increasing preference for filling methods over timbering.   The process of continuous sampling and assaying during stoping is discussed to ensure profitable ore extraction and minimize waste.

## XI. Mechanical Equipment and Underground Transport

Hoover focuses on the mine's mechanical equipment, highlighting the challenges of selecting and arranging machinery that adapts to changing conditions and uncertainties. He analyzes the use of various power sources (water, steam, gas, electricity) for driving winding appliances, haulage equipment, pumps, and drills. He emphasizes the importance of balancing the cost of equipment with its long-term productivity.  Hoover extensively discusses lateral underground transport, comparing hand trucking, animal haulage, and mechanical systems (cable-ways, compressed-air locomotives, electrical haulage).  He further analyzes methods for transporting ore within stopes, highlighting the cost-effectiveness of minimizing manual labor through efficient designs and gravity-assisted systems.

## XII. Mine Drainage and Pumping Systems

Hoover addresses the crucial task of mine drainage, examining factors influencing the choice of pumping systems. He presents a comparative analysis of various systems—steam pumps, compressed-air pumps, electrical pumps, rod-driven pumps, and bailing—considering factors like flexibility, reliability, power conditions, efficiency, and cost.  Hoover emphasizes that the best system is highly context-dependent and requires careful consideration of the mine's specific characteristics and operational context.

## XIII. Machine Drilling, Workshops, and Equipment Improvements

The final segment on mechanical equipment covers machine drilling, comparing compressed-air and electric drills, and examining various drill types based on size and weight. He details the advantages and disadvantages of machine versus hand drilling, noting that the optimal choice depends on factors such as ground conditions, labor costs, and the need for rapid progress.  The chapter addresses the role of workshops in supporting mine operations and the importance of evaluating the cost-effectiveness of equipment upgrades and improvements, which should always be justified by a quick return on investment.

## XIV. Output, Development, and Investment Security

Hoover concludes by exploring the optimal ratio of mine output to its development.  He argues for the theoretical maximum production to minimize overall operating costs, but acknowledges practical limitations posed by capital constraints, the mine's limited life, the risks of overproduction, and the need to balance financial returns with investment security. He emphasizes that rapid development is always beneficial, but the production pace should be tailored to the known ore reserves and the market conditions to provide both good financial returns and stability for investors.

## XV. The Mining Engineering Profession:  Training and Ethics

The book's final chapter reflects on the mining engineering profession itself, describing the crucial blend of technical and commercial expertise required for success.  Hoover highlights the evolution of the profession from a primarily practical trade to a more scientifically based profession demanding advanced education, entrepreneurial skills, and strong ethical considerations. He emphasizes the crucial role of the mining engineer in all stages of a mining project, from valuation and planning to execution and operation, asserting that this profession requires a more comprehensive and holistic approach than many other branches of engineering. He concludes with a powerful statement on the profession's moral obligations:  "In an industry that lends itself so much to speculation and chicanery, there is the duty of every engineer to diminish the opportunity of the vulture so far as is possible."
