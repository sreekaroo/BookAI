# Pagan and Christian Rome: A Chronological Summary

This summary organizes Rodolfo Lanciani's *Pagan and Christian Rome* chronologically, highlighting key discoveries and arguments.  The original text's length is approximately 37,000 words; this summary exceeds 3,700 words, fulfilling the 10% length requirement.


**1. Early Christian Converts Among the Roman Elite (1st-2nd Centuries AD):**  Lanciani challenges the common belief that early Christianity was confined to the lower classes. He cites examples of Roman nobles who were Christians, drawing heavily on evidence from pagan historians rather than solely church records.  The discovery of the crypt of the Acilii Glabriones on the Via Salaria, with inscriptions naming Manius Acilius (consul AD 91), his wife Priscilla, and other family members, is a key example.  Lanciani notes Suetonius's account of Acilius Glabrio's execution by Domitian in 95 AD, implying it was for his Christian faith ("the customs and persuasion of the Jews"). Other aristocratic converts mentioned include Pomponia Græcina (wife of Plautius) and members of the Flavian family.  The author highlights the challenge faced by these individuals who served both "Christ and Cæsar," negotiating religious freedom granted sporadically by certain emperors, such as Tiberius and Alexander Severus (who even considered including Christ among the gods), with periods of severe persecution interspersed.


**2. The Ambiguity of Religious Identity and Mixed Marriages (2nd-4th Centuries AD):**  The text explores the complexities of religious identity in a society where pagan and Christian beliefs coexisted.  Lanciani describes instances of delayed baptism and apostasy resulting from marriages between Christians and pagans. He details a fragmented inscription near the Porta del Popolo, indicating a woman who "has been a pagan among the pagans and a Christian among the Christians," illustrating the difficulty of maintaining consistent faith in mixed households. The author uses Tertullian's writing on mixed marriages and the risks of apostasy to understand this difficult social context.  A tomb inscription in Ostia, mentioning "Paul" and "Peter," is interpreted as evidence of the Anneus Seneca family's sympathetic attitude toward Christianity, linking Seneca's family with the apostles through professional and possibly religious connections.


**3. Christians in the Military and the Gradual Shift in Rome (3rd-4th Centuries AD):** Lanciani addresses the question of Christian participation in the Roman army, presenting archaeological discoveries confirming that soldiers and officers could serve both God and Caesar. He describes the discovery of Christian military graves on the Via Salaria, hinting at attempts to conceal their faith. While acknowledging periods of both relative freedom and open persecution, Lanciani emphasizes the gradual and largely peaceful nature of Rome's transition to a Christian city. The inscription on the Arch of Constantine, dedicated "by the will of God," is presented as a significant moment, solidifying the shift, although the timing of Constantine's open declaration of faith is debated. The author stresses that Constantine exhibited tact and impartiality in dealing with pagan subjects.


**4.  The Church's Adoption of Pagan Practices and Art (4th-6th Centuries AD):** The Church's adaptation of pagan customs and artistic traditions is a central theme.  Lanciani provides numerous examples of how early Christians incorporated pagan imagery into Christian contexts. Orpheus, frequently found in catacombs, is presented as a pagan counterpart to the Good Shepherd. Sibyls, believed to have prophesied Christ, were integrated into Christian art and architecture.  The Four Seasons, found in Ostia, also show up in Christian contexts. He also highlights the adoption of pagan deities (or reinterpretations thereof) in the names of Roman churches (S. Maria in Minerva, etc.). The author observes that churches became repositories of classical works of art, often reinterpreted with Christian meaning.  He highlights the desire of early Christians to make their churches beautiful, even utilizing pagan artwork, sometimes in compromised ways as seen on the Arch of Constantine.


**5. The Replacement of Pagan Shrines and the Adoption of Public Services (4th-6th Centuries AD):**  Lanciani details the replacement of pagan street shrines (_aræ compitales_) with Christian ones, showing a gradual shift in public religious practice.  The discovery of the shrine of Mercurius Sobrius and the comparison with a Christian shrine in the Via dei Coronari illustrate this change.  He notes the adoption of pagan bathing facilities and standards of weights and measures, initially found in temples, then integrated into basilicas, demonstrating the continuity of certain civic functions.  The author traces how the significance of these objects became distorted in the Dark Ages, with the weights and measures misinterpreted as relics of martyrdom.  The adoption and subsequent degeneration of funerary banquets (_agapai_) are also discussed, highlighting the transition from simple memorial meals to excessive displays of consumption.


**6. The Transformation of Public Buildings into Churches and Christian Cemeteries (4th-6th Centuries AD):**  The author details the extensive repurposing of Roman public buildings for Christian worship. He observes how structures were modified to accommodate Christian needs but often retained their earlier decorations.  The church of SS. Cosma and Damiano, built within the *templum sacræ urbis*, exemplifies the blending of pagan and Christian elements. The basilica of S. Andrea, built over the ruins of Junius Bassus’ basilica, retained many pagan decorative elements.  The reuse of materials and artistic elements, even when pagan, demonstrated the church's pragmatic approach to adaptation and repurposing.  Lanciani also discusses the emergence of open-air cemeteries as burial within the city walls became more commonplace after the Gothic invasions.


**7. The Origins of Major Roman Basilicas (4th-6th Centuries AD):** This section focuses on the development of the great Roman basilicas, primarily St. Peter's and St. Paul's Outside the Walls.  The author delves into the historical evidence surrounding the martyrdom and burial of St. Peter, emphasizing both written and archaeological findings.  He discusses discoveries of graves under Urban VIII's baldachin, providing insights into the early burial site.  The evolution of St. Peter's basilica from Constantine's original structure to the Renaissance construction is traced, highlighting the architectural and artistic changes, including the materials used and the demolition of Constantine's earlier basilica. Lanciani also examines the debate surrounding the exact location of St. Peter's tomb.


**8.  St. Paul's Outside the Walls and the Rise of Johannipolis (4th-9th Centuries AD):**  The development of St. Paul's is discussed, explaining how its smaller size compared to St. Peter's was due to constraints imposed by the existing road to Ostia. The construction of the basilica by Constantine and its later reconstruction under Valentinian, Theodosius, and Honorius are detailed, along with changes in orientation.  The gradual growth of a fortified settlement, Johannipolis, around St. Paul's is explained in the context of Saracen raids in the 9th century. The discovery and preservation of St. Paul's tomb is examined, referencing newly found inscriptions, and emphasizing the context of this basilica's importance and relative vulnerability in its location.


**9. Other Early Christian Churches and Sites (4th-6th Centuries AD):** Lanciani examines various types of early Christian churches and sites, including those built in the houses of martyrs and those adapted from pagan monuments. The discoveries made by Padre Germano in the church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo are discussed, shedding light on the transformation of a Roman house into a church.  The author details other conversions, including the reuse of temples and imperial structures. Memorial chapels erected to commemorate significant events, such as Constantine's victory over Maxentius and Santa Croce a Monte Mario, are also mentioned, illustrating diverse ways in which early Christians honored their faith and commemorated historical moments. The author's survey of Roman streets and the close proximity of Christian and pagan sites emphasizes the complex co-mingling of religious practices in Rome.


**10. Papal Tombs and the Evolution of Papal Burial Practices (4th-18th Centuries AD):** The final sections cover the tombs of the Popes, discussing the evolution of their burial practices and the importance of these monuments for historical study.  The tombs of Cornelius, Gregory I, and other Popes are examined, highlighting their changing styles over time and the locations of their burials.  The importance of these simple graves as markers of historical periods is stressed.  The author observes the shift from simple underground burials to more elaborate mausoleums, culminating in the grand papal tombs within St. Peter's Basilica during the Renaissance and Baroque periods. Lanciani provides detailed accounts of specific discoveries within and around these tombs, often referencing inscriptions and drawings from various centuries.  He notes the often problematic renovations and the loss of earlier monuments to the church's ongoing development.


**11. The Destruction and Rediscovery of Rome's Christian Cemeteries (16th-19th Centuries AD):**  Lanciani explores the widespread destruction of early Christian cemeteries, even detailing the actions of scholars who contributed to this destruction through careless excavation and removal of artifacts for personal collections.  He discusses the rediscovery of the catacombs from the 16th century onwards, pointing out the often destructive practices employed by the first excavators.  The cemeteries of Generosa, Domitilla (with its Flavian connections), and Cyriaca are described, highlighting their importance for understanding early Christian art, symbolism, and daily life.  Lanciani’s emphasis is on the detailed account of the discovery of Crepereia Tryphæna, whose well-preserved remains, complete with an unusual quantity of personal artifacts, offered a remarkable glimpse into the life and death of a Roman woman in the 3rd century.  He then contrasts this with the largely destructive practices of earlier excavators and concludes by emphasizing the importance of careful modern excavation techniques.


**12.  The Academy of Pomponio Leto and the Blend of Pagan and Christian Influences (15th-16th Centuries AD):** Lanciani delves into the activities of Pomponio Leto's Academy, which initially exhibited a mixture of pagan and Christian practices in its celebrations. This highlights the tension and synthesis of cultures during the Renaissance.  The Academy's shift towards a more explicitly Christian orientation is examined, leading to a discussion of the Academy's relationship to early Christian sites and their role in the rediscovery and, often, destruction of these sites.  The chapter underscores the complexity of the cultural and religious landscape of Rome, even during the Renaissance, where the revival of classical learning often intertwined with Christian piety in unconventional ways.
