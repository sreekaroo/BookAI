# The Art of Money Getting: A Chronological Summary

This summary breaks down P.T. Barnum's "The Art of Money Getting" into chronological sections, providing detailed explanations and examples from the text.

## 1. The Simplicity and Difficulty of Wealth Accumulation

Barnum begins by acknowledging the relative ease of acquiring wealth in the United States, particularly due to the abundance of land compared to population. He emphasizes that those genuinely seeking independence need only set their minds to it and employ proper means. However, he counters this optimism by highlighting the significant challenge of *keeping* money.  He cites Dr. Franklin's assertion that the path to wealth is "as plain as the road to the mill," consisting of spending less than one earns, and supports this with Mr. Micawber's insightful observation that a small surplus, however modest, leads to happiness, while deficit leads to misery.

## 2. The Misconception of Economy

Barnum then delves into the common misapprehension of true economy. He differentiates true economy from mere stinginess, pointing out that many mistakenly believe saving small amounts justifies excessive spending elsewhere. He uses the example of a farmer's wife who saves on candlelight but overspends on frivolous items, illustrating the concept of "penny wise and pound foolish" –  "saving at the spigot and wasting at the bung-hole."  He further explains that this "one idea" economy, as Punch satirizes, is similar to "buying a penny herring and hiring a coach and four to take it home.”  The core of true economy, he states, is consistently ensuring that income surpasses expenditure.

## 3. The Dangers of Keeping Up Appearances

Barnum criticizes the societal pressure to maintain appearances, particularly in America, despite the claim of "free and equal." He describes individuals who strive to match the lifestyles of the wealthy, ignoring their own financial realities. This leads to wasteful spending, harming the family's true well-being for the sake of outward show. Examples include individuals attempting to emulate wealthier neighbors by hiring carriages or buying imitation shawls. This vanity and envy, he argues, prevent genuine progress.

## 4. The Importance of Health and Avoiding Harmful Habits

Barnum asserts that good health is fundamental to success, serving as the "substratum" of both fortune and happiness.  He acknowledges that some ill health is unavoidable, but criticizes individuals who neglect their health through harmful habits. He particularly condemns tobacco and alcohol use, highlighting their negative impact on clear thinking and judgment. Barnum shares his personal experience with excessive cigar smoking, its detrimental effects on his health, and the difficulties of breaking the habit.  He emphasizes that clear thinking is crucial for successful business planning and decision-making and these habits impair that ability.

## 5. Choosing the Right Vocation and Location

Barnum emphasizes the importance of aligning one's career with natural aptitudes and talents. He criticizes parents who impose vocations on their children without considering their individual inclinations. He uses his own lack of mechanical aptitude as an example, illustrating how pursuing an unsuitable career leads to dissatisfaction and lack of success.  He then focuses on location, using the example of a successful showman in London who struggled due to a poor location but thrived in America, demonstrating that a suitable vocation coupled with the right place is essential for success.

## 6. The Pitfalls of Debt and the Power of Perseverance

Barnum strongly advises against accumulating unnecessary debt, viewing it as a form of enslavement. While acknowledging exceptions like strategic land purchases, he cautions against acquiring debt for everyday expenses. He vividly illustrates how debt erodes self-respect and leads to a vicious cycle of working for past consumption. He emphasizes that money is a valuable servant when controlled but a tyrannical master when it controls you through debt. He uses John Randolph's maxim, "pay as you go," as a key to financial freedom.  Barnum emphasizes the importance of perseverance and self-reliance. He contrasts two types of generals, one decisive and persevering, the other hesitant and indecisive, highlighting how perseverance leads to triumph. He encourages readers to cultivate self-reliance and a positive outlook, drawing on the proverb,  "He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand; but the hand of the diligent maketh rich."

## 7.  The Importance of Dedication and System

Barnum urges readers to approach their chosen work with total dedication: "Whatever you do, do it with all your might." He emphasizes thoroughness, highlighting that half-hearted efforts rarely lead to success.  He advocates for systematically managing one's business, having a place and time for everything, as opposed to the haphazard approach of those who are never truly done with their work. However, he cautions against excessive systematization which can become counterproductive.  The example of the hotel waiter's rigid adherence to a flawed system, enforcing soup consumption before fish, illustrates this point.

## 8.  Staying Informed and Avoiding Outside Operations

Barnum highlights the importance of staying current with events and information by reading newspapers. He describes those who fail to do so as being cut off from society and progress.  He cautions against "outside operations" - risky speculations outside one's core area of expertise. He warns that even highly successful individuals can lose their fortunes by engaging in ventures they don't understand, emphasizing the need to stick to what you know.

## 9.  The Wisdom of Prudence in Financial Dealings

Barnum strongly cautions against endorsing notes or acting as surety without sufficient security. He uses a detailed example to illustrate how easily such seemingly safe endorsements can lead to catastrophic financial losses for both the borrower and the endorser. The key principle is that lending to someone too readily removes the inherent value of money and increases the risk of poor financial decisions.

## 10.  The Power of Advertising and Customer Relations

Barnum emphasizes the importance of advertising for reaching the public.  He uses the example of Genin, the hatter, who purchased a costly Jenny Lind concert ticket simply for the advertising value, achieving significant business growth. However, he warns that effective advertising requires a genuine, high-quality product and consistent effort, citing the anecdote of a man whose limited advertising campaign failed.  He stresses the crucial role of politeness and kindness in building customer loyalty, reminding readers that losing customers due to rudeness is detrimental to business success.

## 11.  Charity, Discretion, and Integrity

Barnum stresses the importance of charity and generosity not only morally but also as a business strategy.  He distinguishes between indiscriminately giving and strategically supporting those who are willing to help themselves.  He also emphasizes discretion in business dealings, advising against revealing one's secrets and intentions. Above all, he advocates for maintaining unwavering integrity, noting that honesty is not only morally right but also the best policy for long-term success. He concludes by stating that true success goes beyond mere wealth accumulation, encompassing character and the use of wealth for the greater good.  He highlights the importance of avoiding the pitfalls of miserliness, concluding that wealth, when responsibly used, can significantly benefit humanity.
