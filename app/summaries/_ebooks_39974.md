## Handbook of Alabama Archaeology: Part I, Point Types - A Chronological Summary

**I. Introduction and Classification Methodology:**

The book aims to establish a unified nomenclature for projectile point types in Alabama and surrounding regions.  The authors, Cambron and Hulse, meticulously classified a vast collection of approximately 150,000 artifacts from over 400 sites, primarily in the Tennessee Valley. They employed a combination of cultural and physical characteristics, including measurements, shapes, flaking, and materials, to define point types.  Each type received a name and code number.  The authors emphasized rigorous standards, stating, "Points are not 'pushed' into a named type; if the type could not accurately be determined the point was placed in a provisional type." Control sites like Stanfield-Worley Bluff Shelter and Flint Creek Rock Shelter provided chronological context. The introduction also notes that hafting methods and flaking techniques offer valuable insights into cultural associations.

**II. Paleo-Indian Period (Pre-10,000 BP):**

The earliest period represented is the Paleo-Indian, featuring Clovis and its unfluted variant.  The Clovis point is described as "a medium to large, auriculate, fluted point with incurvate base," with measurements averaging 66mm long, 27mm wide, and 7mm thick, though examples ranged from 35mm to 154mm. The authors detail the complex fluting process, suggesting indirect percussion was used after preparing a "striking platform" at the base.  The Unfluted Clovis, similar in shape but lacking flutes, is also discussed, raising the possibility that some Clovis points were simply unfluted. The text mentions debated radiocarbon dates for Clovis, with some exceeding 37,000 BP, while others suggest an age of around 15,000 years ago.  The Cumberland point, another Paleo-Indian type, is characterized as "a medium to large, auriculate, fluted point displaying hafting constriction."  The authors detail the multi-stage fluting process employed to create the Cumberland point.  The Beaver Lake point, a transitional Paleo type, is an auriculate point with recurvate blade edges.

**III. Transitional Paleo-Indian Period (10,000-5000 BP):**

This transitional phase shows evidence of evolving techniques and styles.  The Colbert Dalton is a medium-sized, auriculate point with a rectangular hafting area, showcasing "short, sharp, regular serrations" on the blade edges.  The Greenbrier Dalton, a variant, possesses "expanded-rounded auricles." The Jeff point, a broad, auriculate point with a straight basal edge, is noted for its association with early uniface tools.  The Hardaway point, a small-to-medium side-notched point, shows a concave base and is associated with Daltons and Quad points at the Hardaway site.  The Quad point, a medium-sized, auriculate point with an expanded-rounded base, is found in both fluted and unfluted forms, and is linked to early materials at the type site and in other early contexts. The Big Sandy point, a small-to-medium side-notched point with ground basal edges and notches, presents a significant type with variations in flaking techniques and basal edge types. The authors present two types, Big Sandy I and Big Sandy II, representing different temporal positions within the Archaic period. The text also introduces several other related subtypes such as Big Sandy Auriculate, Big Sandy Broad Base, and Big Sandy Contracted Base.

**IV. Early Archaic Period (5000-4000 BP):**

This period sees the emergence of various stemmed and notched points. The Kirk Corner Notched point, a medium-to-large corner-notched point with serrated blade edges, showcases "pronounced serrations and beveling." The Kirk Serrated point, a related type, displays a straight stem and deep serrations. The Decatur point, a small-to-medium, corner-notched point, is characterized by diagonal flakes struck from the base.  The Ecusta point, small, triangular, and side-notched, is described as having serrated and beveled blade edges. The authors note its similarity to Decatur and Plevna points, also having "diagonal flakes struck from the base." The LeCroy point, medium-sized and bifurcated-stemmed, often displays serrations and beveling.  The Paint Rock Valley point, medium-sized and triangular, possesses an incurvate base and excurvate blade edges.  The Harpeth River is a notable medium-to-large side-notched point, "flattened [in cross-section], beveled on both sides of each face, and displays shallow serrations," representing a likely transitional type between Paleo and Early Archaic.

**V. Middle Archaic Period (4000-3000 BP):**

The Middle Archaic is marked by a continuation of earlier point types and new variants. The Kays point, medium-to-large and straight-stemmed, exhibits excurvate blade edges and is compared to the Genesee points of New York, with similar radiocarbon dates.  The Elora point, large, thick, and broad-stemmed, has an unfinished base. The authors describe a serrated variant, "Elora Serrated," and note the significance of the unfinished base as a defining characteristic.  The Eva point, medium-to-large and basally notched, showcases excurvate or recurvate blades. The authors also note an Eva II variant.  The Angostura point, medium-to-large and auriculate, has an excurvate blade and is discussed in relation to its initial discovery in South Dakota and later finds in the Tennessee Valley, ranging in dates from 6000 to 4000 BC and later.  The Guilford point, medium-to-large and lanceolate, has an incurvate base, and is associated with the Carolina Piedmont and other regions.


**VI. Late Archaic Period (3000-2000 BP):**

This period shows continued development and diversification of projectile point types. The Big Slough point, medium-to-large with a broad, expanded stem, showcases recurvate and excurvate blade edges and is noted for its variability in flaking techniques.  The Appalachian point, medium-to-large and stemmed with a concave base, is made of quartzite and is associated with early Woodland cultures. The authors specify its presence in the Southern Appalachian region and its association with Savannah River points. The Maples point, a large, thin, broad stemmed point with an excurvate base, marks the later Archaic and earliest Woodland period. The authors note its occurrence in shellmounds and on several sites.  The Wade point, a medium-sized, barbed, straight-stemmed point, showcases recurvate blade edges and has an acute distal end.

**VII. Early Woodland Period (2000 BC - 500 AD):**

This period sees the introduction of pottery and other cultural changes reflected in projectile point styles. The Bakers Creek point, a medium-sized point with an expanded stem, is found in association with Copena and triangular Copena points and displays an early-to-middle Woodland cultural affiliation. The Copena point, medium-to-large and trianguloid with recurvate edges, is linked to the Copena burial mound culture and often called "Southern Hopewell." The Copena Triangular, a related type, maintains a trianguloid shape but with parallel hafting area sides. The Benton Stemmed point, medium-to-large and stemmed, displays steeply beveled stem edges.  The Benton Broad Stemmed variant exhibits an exceptionally broad stem.  The Buzzard Roost Creek point, medium-to-large and bifurcated-stemmed, has recurvate blade edges and beveled stem edges.  The Camp Creek point, small to medium and triangular, showcases an incurvate base. The authors cite its association with early to middle Woodland cultures.

**VIII. Middle and Late Woodland Period (500 AD - 1000 AD):**

The Middle and Late Woodland is represented by types like the Adena point. The classic Adena is described as "medium to large, with a long, very broad, sometimes rounded stem." The Adena Narrow Stemmed variant possesses a long, rounded stem and excurvate blade. The authors emphasize the close relationship between these two types, suggesting potential temporal or cultural differences. The Frazier point, a medium-sized, narrow triangular point, displays a well-thinned basal edge. The authors indicate this point's relative rarity and uncertain cultural associations in Alabama.  The  Ebenezer point, a small point with a short, rounded stem and excurvate blade edges, is associated with early Woodland artifacts.  The authors note its similarities to Clifton points.


**IX. Late Woodland and Mississippian Period (1000 AD - 1600 AD):**

The later periods witness the emergence of smaller, simpler points.  The Hamilton point, small and triangular, features incurvate blade edges and an incurvate base, and is linked to the Hamilton culture of eastern Tennessee. The Hamilton Stemmed variant is a larger point with an expanded stem and excurvate blade. The Madison point, small and thin triangular, is associated with the Middle Mississippian culture and is also described as "Late Mississippi Triangular" by Kneberg.  The Nodena point, small-to-medium and lanceolate, has a rounded base. The authors mention the point's resemblance to a willow-leaf type.  The Fort Ancient point, small-to-medium and triangular, sometimes serrated, is associated with the Fort Ancient aspect of the Ohio Valley, exhibiting a mixed cultural background with Woodland and Mississippian elements. The text notes that the Fort Ancient aspect possibly persisted into the 17th century.


**X. Provisional Types and Distribution:**

The final section addresses projectile points too variable or incomplete for definitive classification.  These "provisional types" are categorized numerically and are described broadly based on their shapes and features (stemmed, expanded stem, corner notched, triangular, rounded base). The authors emphasize that future research might allow for the separation of some of these provisional types into named categories.  A distribution chart summarizes the occurrence of each point type in various Alabama counties.  The book concludes with a glossary defining key terms related to point typology, flaking techniques, and cultural periods.
