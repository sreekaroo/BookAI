# The House in Good Taste: A Summary

## I. The Modern Home's Awakening

Elsie de Wolfe's "The House in Good Taste" begins by noting a significant shift in American attitudes towards home design.  She observes a burgeoning desire for improvement, moving beyond mere functionality to embrace aesthetic standards.  De Wolfe rejects the "useless, overcharged house" of the wealthy, advocating instead for a return to the rational, beautiful simplicity of ancestral homes.  The core principle: "Houses and furniture fulfilled their uses, and if an object fulfils its mission the chances are that it is beautiful." This awakening is driven by women, who, unlike men who created grand, impractical houses,  shaped the home into a comfortable and intimate space.  She emphasizes the importance of choosing an architect who understands and respects the client's personality and vision.

## II. The Architect's Role and Early Influences

De Wolfe stresses the crucial role of the architect in achieving a harmonious and efficient home.  She advises selecting someone with common sense and artistic ability, suggesting: "Select for your architect a man you'd like for a friend." The author then traces the historical development of the modern house, highlighting influential women like Isabella d'Este and the Marquise de Rambouillet.  Isabella d'Este's "Grotta," a personal retreat, foreshadowed the move towards simplicity and reticence. The Marquise de Rambouillet's Hôtel Rambouillet, created as a reaction against courtly excess, further established the importance of intimacy and suitability in home design.  The book notes that while men created the grand houses, it was women who transformed them into homes.

## III.  Suitability, Simplicity, and Proportion in Design

De Wolfe introduces her core design principles: suitability, simplicity, and proportion. She emphasizes the importance of proper lighting placement: "How rarely does one find the lights in the right place in our over-magnificent hotels and residences!"  She also criticizes the overuse of steam heat and advocates for open fireplaces for a more natural and comfortable atmosphere. The author connects a person's taste in home decor directly to their character, asserting: "We attribute vulgar qualities to those who are content to live in ugly surroundings. We endow with refinement and charm the person who welcomes us in a delightful room."  She urges readers to cultivate their taste by learning to recognize suitability, simplicity, and proportion in their furnishings.

## IV. The Washington Irving House: A Case Study in Transformation

The author details the transformation of the old Washington Irving house, her beloved home with Elizabeth Marbury.  This serves as a case study showcasing her design philosophy.  De Wolfe describes how she addressed the narrow entrance hall using mirrors and a green-and-white striped wallpaper to create a sense of spaciousness. The treatment of the drawing-room, with its rose and cream color scheme and carefully placed artwork, is analyzed. The ingenious transformation of a bay window into a charming conservatory with a fountain is also described. The dining room’s gray and white and ivory color scheme is highlighted, emphasizing how minimal color could maximize effect.

## V. Bedrooms and the Pursuit of Intimacy

The author shifts focus to the bedrooms, stressing the importance of creating an intimate and personal space.  She details her own and Miss Marbury's bedrooms in the Washington Irving house, highlighting the inclusion of comfortable seating, reading lights, and writing tables as crucial elements. De Wolfe notes: "My own bedroom in this house was very pleasant to me… my bedroom had to be my writing-and reading-room too," illustrating the integration of functionality and personal style.  The bedrooms reflect the personalities of the occupants, with Miss Marbury's featuring white enamel furniture and a bold Bird of Paradise chintz, contrasting with de Wolfe's more romantic, rose-toned French style.

## VI. The "Little House of Many Mirrors"

De Wolfe describes the transformation of a gloomy brownstone into a light-filled home. The redesign started with creating a fore-court to soften the harsh entrance: "I tore away the ugly stone steps and centered the entrance door in a little stone-paved fore-court." The strategic use of mirrors throughout the house, especially in the stairwell, is emphasized to maximize light and space. The black and white entrance hall, with its wall fountain and carefully placed objects, provides a striking example of how minimal color and strategically placed mirrors can enhance the feeling of space.  De Wolfe cleverly uses mirrors to "seemingly double the spaciousness".

## VII.  Wall Treatments: Painted Walls and Wallpapers

De Wolfe emphasizes the importance of treating walls as architectural elements.  She advocates for painted walls as the most beautiful option, emphasizing the need for proper plastering and painting techniques.  She discusses the impact of wall color on the feel of a room, noting the importance of light colors for south-facing rooms and warmer tones for north-facing ones: "Dull tones and cool colors are always good in south rooms, and live tones and warm colors in north rooms." De Wolfe also discusses the use of wallpapers, advocating for simple and well-designed papers and cautioning against busy patterns, which she finds "distressing".  She uses various examples throughout her book to emphasize the importance of harmony between wall treatments, woodwork, and furniture.

## VIII. The Art of Color and its Emotional Impact

The chapter on color emphasizes the psychological impact of color on mood and temperament.  De Wolfe states: "If you are inclined to a hasty temper, for instance, you should not live in a room in which the prevailing note is red." The author highlights the importance of understanding one's own color sense, advising readers to experiment and discover which colors evoke positive emotions. De Wolfe uses examples from nature to illustrate harmonious color schemes, showcasing the importance of background, and she details the creation of rooms based on a central element like a Chinese jar, illustrating how a color scheme can build from a single object.

## IX.  Lighting and its Importance

De Wolfe highlights the often-overlooked importance of lighting in home design. She stresses the need for proper placement of light fixtures to enhance functionality and beauty. "I always see that each room shall have its lights placed for the comfort of its occupants. There must be lights in sheltered corners of the fireplace, by the writing-desk, on each side of the dressing-table, and so on."  She criticizes the poor lighting in hotels and residences and urges readers to plan their lighting carefully, considering both natural light and artificial light sources.  De Wolfe advocates for simple and elegant fixtures, criticizing the use of gaudy and cheap ones.  The use of candlesticks and adaptable lamps made from repurposed jars are proposed as both functional and aesthetically pleasing options.

## X. Halls, Staircases, and the Drawing Room

De Wolfe discusses halls and staircases, tracing their evolution from functional spaces to architectural features.  She highlights the grandeur of Italian and French staircases and contrasts them with the simpler designs of Colonial American homes.  She advocates for a formal and restrained treatment of halls, warning against making them too "pretty."  The design principles of balance and proportion are further illustrated in her description of the Colony Club's hallway.  The drawing room is positioned as a space for elegant hospitality, emphasizing comfortable seating and a sense of intimacy rather than cold formality. The author notes the importance of using mirrors effectively and discourages the clutter of bric-a-brac, advocating for a focus on carefully chosen objects d'art.


## XI. Living Rooms, Boudoirs, and Bedrooms

The living room is described as a space for comfortable family living and emphasizes the importance of creating a welcoming, slightly lived-in atmosphere.  The need for order without formality is highlighted. De Wolfe uses the example of a living room in the Harkness house, showing how multiple seating areas and tables can create conversation spaces.  The boudoir, for her, is a woman's personal sanctuary, a hybrid of bedroom and office, prioritizing intimacy and comfort. Miss Anne Morgan's Louis XVI boudoir is used as an example of elegant and individualistic style.  The chapter returns to bedroom design, emphasizing the importance of suitable lighting, adequate closet space and comfort.


## XII. Dining Rooms and Their Transformation

The dining room is presented as a space for joyful gatherings.  De Wolfe advocates for light and cheerful color schemes, rejecting the common gloominess of traditional dining rooms.  She uses various examples, such as the Georgian dining room in the Iselin house, to illustrate how simplicity and carefully chosen elements can create a sophisticated yet welcoming atmosphere.  Painted furniture and built-in cupboards and consoles are praised for their beauty and practicality.  De Wolfe notes the importance of balancing elements like wall panels and mirrors and shows disapproval of cluttering the room with unnecessary displays of china and silverware. The use of outdoor dining spaces is also encouraged.

## XIII. Small Apartments and the Art of Space Maximization

The chapter addresses the challenges and opportunities of decorating small apartments. De Wolfe emphasizes the importance of choosing an apartment with adequate light, air, and a reasonably sized living area. The chapter stresses the need for careful planning and urges readers to prioritize essential furniture pieces and strategic built-in furniture before buying anything.  De Wolfe warns against the pitfalls of buying furniture before securing the apartment, showcasing the importance of knowing the space and its limitations before making any purchasing decisions.   The chapter concludes with advice on maximizing space through the use of simple, multi-functional furniture and neutral color schemes.  

## XIV. Reproductions and the Pursuit of Authenticity

The final chapter addresses the issue of antique furniture and reproductions, cautioning readers against the prevalence of fakes. The author acknowledges the difficulty in identifying authentic antiques even for experts, and offers the advice that "the less a copy suggests an attempt at 'artistic reproduction,' the more literal and mechanical it is in its copy of the original, the better it is." She advocates for the use of high-quality reproductions that accurately capture the essence of antique designs rather than striving for flawed perfection. De Wolfe encourages a focus on quality and suitability over the mere pursuit of an object’s age, highlighting the importance of using furniture that fits both the space and the lifestyle of the occupants. The chapter highlights the value of well-made reproductions that can offer both beauty and functionality and will last generations.


## XV. Trellis Work and Garden Design

This chapter discusses the history and application of trellis work in architecture and garden design.  De Wolfe highlights examples from various cultures and periods, emphasizing the versatility of trellis in creating architectural features both indoors and outdoors.  The author details the creation of the trellis room in the Colony Club and a similar space in Mrs. Ormond-Smith's house, showcasing how trellis can be used to create an intimate and elegant atmosphere. The author notes that trellis, unlike lattice, requires an architectural sensibility. The inclusion of fountains and other elements within trellis structures is highlighted.  The chapter also explores the use of trellis in garden design, using her own garden at Villa Trianon as an example.

## XVI. Villa Trianon: A Personal Paradise

The final section provides a personal narrative of de Wolfe's acquisition and restoration of Villa Trianon in Versailles.  This detailed account illustrates her design philosophy applied to a larger scale project.  The story emphasizes the importance of vision and perseverance in realizing a design dream,  illustrating how an old, neglected property can be transformed into a beautiful and comfortable home.  De Wolfe details the restoration process, from initial negotiations to the final design and planting of the garden, highlighting the collaboration with Victorien Sardou and Monsieur de Nolhac. The story underscores the enduring appeal of old-world craftsmanship and the value of respecting a property’s history while incorporating modern conveniences.  The Villa Trianon serves as a culminating example of her design principles, emphasizing the harmonious blend of history, architecture, and personal style.
