## The Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci: A Chronological Summary

This summary condenses the extensive text provided, organizing Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks chronologically into thematic paragraphs.  Due to the inherent disorder of the original manuscripts, some thematic overlap is unavoidable.

**I. Early Ambitions and Artistic Principles (circa 1478-1490)**

Leonardo's earliest entries reveal a nascent genius grappling with artistic principles and the ethics of his profession.  He already demonstrates a deep-seated conviction in the primacy of nature as the ultimate teacher: "He who can go to the fountain does not go to the water-jar." He stresses diligent observation over haste, advising aspiring artists to "always go slowly to work in your drawing," mastering light, shadow, and proportion before seeking speed. This period also shows his early preoccupation with the function of the eye and the mechanics of perspective, foreshadowing his later scientific endeavors. A noteworthy entry from 1478 mentions beginning work on "two Madonna [pictures]," hinting at his early artistic productivity.

**II. Milanese Patronage and the Sforza Monument (1490-1499)**

Leonardo's move to Milan brings new commissions and a monumental undertaking: the equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza.  Notes from 1490 mark the recommencement of work on the "horse," indicating a long and iterative process.  His entries reveal meticulous planning and experimentation with bronze casting techniques, including the use of "river sand wetted with vinegar" for quick molds and detailed instructions for constructing and reinforcing the colossal mold in pieces. He laments the "evil nature of men" who might misuse his inventions, particularly those for underwater operations, showing a concern for the ethical implications of his work.  The extensive sketches of the horse demonstrate Leonardo's dedication to capturing the animal's lifelike qualities.

**III.  Light, Shade, and Perspective in Painting (1490s - 1510s)**

The Milanese period shows Leonardo's continued exploration of perspective, light, and shadow, with a focus on their applications in painting. He proposes a three-part structure for his "book on painting," outlining "Linear Perspective," "The Perspective of Colour," and "The Perspective of Disappearance." His writings delve into the intricacies of light and shadow—primary, derived, and cast—with detailed descriptions and numerous diagrams. His exploration of the "camera obscura" reveals his understanding of how images are formed, demonstrating a remarkable grasp of optics and its relevance to artistic representation. He frequently emphasizes the importance of observing and understanding the effects of light and shade on the human eye and on various objects.

**IV.  Anatomy and the Human Form (1490s - 1516)**

Leonardo's anatomical studies, undertaken through numerous dissections, represent a significant contribution to scientific understanding. His introspective notes reveal the arduous nature of his work, saying, "I have dissected more than ten human bodies... to obtain a true and perfect knowledge." He meticulously planned the arrangement of his anatomical treatises, intending to present them systematically in a series of drawings showing the human body from various viewpoints, aiming for "a true and complete knowledge of all you wish to learn of the human figure".  His explorations extend to comparative anatomy, comparing human and animal forms.

**V.  Theories of Color and Aerial Perspective (1510s - 1516)**

During this period, Leonardo systematically addresses the impact of distance and atmosphere on color perception.  He details "Aerial Perspective," explaining how atmospheric conditions influence the apparent color and clarity of objects at varying distances.  He emphasizes the use of "natural perspective" over more artificial schemes, arguing for accuracy and realism. His experiments with color mixing and reflections indicate a deep understanding of how surrounding environments affect the perceived hue of objects. His notes reveal his interest in the rainbow's formation, attributing its colors not solely to the sun but to factors such as moisture in the air.

**VI.  The Last Supper and Artistic Practice (1490s)**

Leonardo's notes on the Last Supper provide invaluable insights into his creative process.  He meticulously outlines the poses and gestures of the apostles, emphasizing how these actions should convey the characters' emotions and the narrative's unfolding. He details the composition with precise indications of the figures' positions, aiming to depict emotional nuances. He uses brief notation in his sketches like: "One who was drinking and has left the glass in its position and turned his head towards the speaker," revealing the planning behind this masterpiece.

**VII.  The Battle of Anghiari and Composition (1504-1506)**

Leonardo's preparations for the Battle of Anghiari, a lost mural, are evident in numerous surviving sketches.  Though the final composition is lost, his studies reveal his approach to depicting large-scale battles—the smoke, dust, and the myriad individual actions of soldiers and horses.  While a detailed description of the battle exists, its authorship is debated; however, related drawings clearly demonstrate his method of composing dynamic scenes through a multitude of individual figures. The surviving sketches provide some idea of the work's dynamism and complexity.

**VIII.  Later Years and Architectural Studies (1508-1518)**

Leonardo's later years show a shift toward architectural and engineering studies.  Notes from 1508 and later indicate his interest in town planning, canal construction, and the construction of domes and other architectural forms. His sketches reveal an intricate understanding of engineering principles, reflected in detailed plans and analyses of structural integrity, particularly with regard to domes and arches. His concern for structural stability is evident in his detailed analysis of cracks in walls and methods to prevent them.

**IX.  Travels and Topographical Observations (1502, 1511, 1518)**

Leonardo's notebooks offer geographical insights into various regions he visited.  His travels in central Italy (1502) are documented through sketches and location-specific notes, highlighting his keen observation of terrain and local phenomena. His trip to Monboso (possibly Monte Rosa) in 1511 is described with detailed meteorological observations, demonstrating his scientific approach to natural phenomena.  His final years in France (Amboise) are marked by notes on the Loire river, demonstrating his constant engagement with observing natural forces and their influence on landscape.

**X.  Final Years, Personal Reflections, and Legacy (1510s - 1519)**

The final years of Leonardo's life are revealed through letters and personal records. His correspondence with patrons reveals his financial struggles and professional relationships. His notes on his pupils—Giacomo, Salai, and others—provide glimpses into the dynamics of his workshop.  His will, finalized in 1518, bequeaths his belongings to Francesco Melzi and his servants, revealing his personal attachments and a commitment to the patronage system. The collection of maxims and reflections highlight his ethical compass and deep interest in the forces of nature, emphasizing experience as the foundation of knowledge.  His insightful comments on life, death, human folly, and the pursuit of knowledge demonstrate the enduring wisdom and perspective of a true Renaissance polymath.
