## How France Built Her Cathedrals: A Chronological Summary

**I. The Pre-Gothic Era and the Rebirth of Building:**  The book begins by emphasizing the profound connection between architecture and memory, highlighting the destructive acts of various periods (1793, 1562, 1914) that attempted to sever this link.  It argues that French Gothic architecture, far from being a sudden innovation, was a logical progression from Romanesque. The Romanesque style, itself a fusion of Roman basilica plans and "barbarian or Oriental" elements, adapted to the evolving needs of the Catholic liturgy, incorporating features like transepts, ambulatories, and raised chancels.  The 9th and 10th centuries were marked by widespread destruction and social unrest, but after the year 1000, a "new spirit" animated French builders, leading to the Romanesque rebirth.  The powerful Cluny monastery was a significant force in this revival, fostering agriculture, crafts, and, crucially, architecture.  The author quotes Raoul Glaber's description of the period: "The whole earth...seemed to throw off its tatters of old age and to reclothe itself in a white mantle of churches."  Different regional Romanesque schools emerged, each with its own distinct characteristics (Normandy, Burgundy, Auvergne, Poitou, Languedoc, Provence).  A central challenge was the development of durable masonry vaulting to replace vulnerable wooden roofs.


**II. The Dawn of Gothic at St. Denis:** The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is explored, focusing on the Ile-de-France region as the birthplace of the new style.  Several early-Gothic churches in the Ile-de-France, such as Morienval (with its early Gothic-vaulted ambulatory), St. Étienne at Beauvais, and St. Germer-en-Flay, are examined as examples of experimental developments.  The book highlights the pivotal role of Abbot Suger at St. Denis.  Suger, described as "truly great in all things," is credited with definitively combining the pointed arch with intersecting ribs, creating a system of "thrust and counterthrust" that allowed for lighter structures and larger windows. His abbey church at St. Denis (dedicated in 1144), became a model for other churches across France. Suger himself described the church's beauty, likening it to "the radiance of precious stones," emphasizing its ability to lift the soul to "divine meditation."


**III. Primary Gothic Cathedrals: The First Wave of Innovation:**  The book examines five key Primary Gothic cathedrals: Noyon, Senlis, Sens, Laon, and Soissons. Each is presented individually, but collectively, they represent the early confident steps of the Gothic style. Noyon, with its communal charter of 1109, is highlighted, and the construction of its cathedral, which started circa 1150, is linked to the blossoming of communal life. Senlis's west portal sculpture (circa 1180) marks a significant date in the evolution of Gothic imagery. Sens's unique use of twin columns in its choir and the story of St. Thomas Becket's refuge there illustrate the cathedral's historical significance.  Laon Cathedral, perched atop a hill, demonstrates the architectural ambition of the era, despite its incomplete state. Soissons Cathedral's southern transept (circa 1180) is singled out as "the most exquisite thing in France," showcasing the refined elegance of early Gothic. The devastating impact of WWI on these cities and their cathedrals is also noted.


**IV. Notre Dame of Paris: A Scholastic Masterpiece:**  Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, a supreme example of Gothic architecture, receives dedicated attention. Its construction, begun in 1163, is discussed in relation to the flourishing scholastic intellectual climate of Paris. The author draws parallels between the "supreme scholastic" Thomas Aquinas's *Summa* and the cathedral itself, both representing a "summation" of their respective fields. The significant roles of successive bishops in the cathedral's construction are detailed, and emphasis is placed on the masterful sculpture of its capitals and the unique arrangement of double aisles. The author mentions that the exterior is unsurpassed and that the west facade is considered a classic.


**V. The Great Cathedrals: Chartres, Rheims, and Amiens:** This section delves into the three other great cathedrals often grouped with Notre Dame. Chartres Cathedral, begun after a devastating fire in 1194, is praised for its magnificent stained-glass windows and the "most beautiful tower in the world." Rheims Cathedral, begun in 1211, is described as the culmination of Gothic art, with its awe-inspiring sculptures and its role as the coronation site for French monarchs, including Charles VII and Jeanne d'Arc.  Amiens Cathedral, started in 1220, is called the "Parthenon of Gothic art," lauded for its harmonious proportions, vastness, and masterful sculpture, especially at the Vierge Dorée portal (circa 1280).  The tragic destruction wrought by WWI on Rheims is recounted in detail, emphasizing the deliberate nature of the attack.


**VI. Lesser Great Cathedrals: Diverse Regional Styles:** Six additional significant cathedrals, Bourges, Beauvais, Troyes, Tours, Lyons, and Le Mans, are grouped together, showcasing the diversity of regional Gothic styles while maintaining the high standards of the great cathedrals. Bourges, unique for its lack of transepts and its double aisles, is highlighted for its innovative design. Beauvais, a majestic fragment featuring a soaring choir and transept, showcases the extreme height achieved by Gothic architecture, and the controversy surrounding its possible English influence. Troyes Cathedral's wealth of stained glass from the 13th and 14th centuries is emphasized, along with the unique plan of St. Urbain church. Tours, expressing the classical restraint of Touraine, is noteworthy for its high quality stained glass. Lyons Cathedral, with its strong apostolic associations, exhibits a mix of northern and southern influences, including unique marble incrustations. Le Mans, with its blending of Romanesque and Gothic elements, represents the transition and the later flourishing of the style.


**VII. Plantagenet Gothic: A Fusion of Styles:**  The book introduces Plantagenet Gothic, a distinct style that developed in the southwest of France (Anjou, Poitou, etc.) under Angevin rule.  The author highlights the defining characteristic of this school: its "bombé" or cup-shaped vaults.  This vault style is explained as a fusion of the region's existing cupola tradition and the diagonal ribs of northern Gothic.  The development of Plantagenet Gothic is divided into three periods based on the increasing complexity of the rib structures.


**VIII. The Cupola Churches of Aquitaine:** Several notable churches with cupola-vaults in Aquitaine are explored as precursors to Plantagenet Gothic.  St. Front at Périgueux, with its five domes, is discussed in detail, highlighting the controversy surrounding its dating and the significant liberties taken by its restorer, Abadie. The Cathedral of Angoulême, begun in 1109, with its rich facade and impressive domes, is also analyzed. The prominent role of Fontevrault Abbey, with its unique plan and the tombs of Henry II, Richard the Lionheart, and Eleanor of Aquitaine, further elucidates the historical and architectural context of the region.


**IX.  Plantagenet Gothic: Angers, Saumur, and Poitiers:**  The three major centers of Plantagenet Gothic are explored, focusing on the evolution of the "bombé" vault in different buildings.  Angers Cathedral's nave demonstrates the early, heavier form of the style.  Saumur displays various examples across the three periods of Plantagenet Gothic, including St. Pierre's church and St. Florent-les-Saumur's early eight-branch vault. Poitiers Cathedral, begun by Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine, showcases a successful blending of Poitevin Romanesque traditions with Angevin Gothic vaulting, along with its incredibly famous Crucifixion window.  The book notes that this window is considered one of the most glorious windows in the world.


**X. Gothic in the Midi: Regional Variations and the Albigensian Crusade:**  The final section examines the Gothic architecture of the Midi, emphasizing the region's unique characteristics.  It highlights how Gothic wasn't an indigenous development but arrived in the wake of political events and the integration of Languedoc into the French kingdom. Albi Cathedral, a formidable fortress-church built of brick, is analyzed for its unique aisleless nave and the significance of its construction during the Albigensian Crusade. The Albigensian heresy and its suppression during the crusade is extensively covered to better understand the political and religious context of the Midi Gothic styles.  The book emphasizes the regional variations in Gothic style, mentioning cathedrals such as those at Toulouse, Narbonne, Bordeaux, and Avignon.  It also discusses the significant stained-glass windows of Troyes and the remarkable fortress-city of Aigues-Mortes, as well as lesser churches in Provence, including St. Maximin. The book concludes by reflecting on the intertwined factors that led to the decline of Gothic architecture – the rise of the Renaissance, the influence of the printing press, and the impact of the Protestant Reformation.  The author reiterates the enduring spirit of France, connecting the nation's builders to its soldiers in the recent war.
