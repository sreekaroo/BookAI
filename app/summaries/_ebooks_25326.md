# Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects, Vol. 1: A Summary

This summary organizes Giorgio Vasari's *Lives*, Volume 1, into chronological paragraphs, offering detailed descriptions and relevant quotes.


## 1. The Pre-Flood and Ancient World: Speculation and Legacy

Vasari begins by speculating about the origins of painting and sculpture, suggesting a pre-Flood existence based on biblical accounts and historical narratives. He references Belus's statue, Semiramis's artistic embellishments of Babylon, and Rachel's stolen idols, showcasing early artistic endeavors.  He then moves to the Greek and Roman worlds, citing Homer's description of Achilles' shield and Pliny's accounts of early painting techniques.  The names of renowned classical artists like Apelles and Praxiteles, and their highly valued works, are mentioned, highlighting the status of art in antiquity.  This section establishes the long history of artistic creation before the Italian Renaissance.


## 2. The Decline of Art in Rome: From Constantine to the Goths

Vasari documents the gradual decline of art in Rome from the era of Constantine onwards. He observes a deterioration in quality in sculpture and painting, as evident in the less sophisticated works found on Constantine's triumphal arch compared to earlier Roman works. The shift of the Empire to Byzantium and subsequent barbarian invasions (Visigoths, Vandals, etc.) brought further destruction and loss of artistic knowledge. Vasari describes the destruction of classical artworks and the resulting decline in craftsmanship.


## 3. The Lombard Period and the Rise of a New Style: A Gradual Recovery

Vasari recounts the continuation of artistic decline under the Lombards. He describes various churches and buildings from this era in Italy, noting their size but criticizing their lack of design and grace.  The introduction of the "German" building style is mentioned, highlighting the influence of non-Italian architecture. However, Vasari also indicates a slight improvement, attributing it to figures like Buono, who worked in Ravenna, Naples, and Venice, even though the quality of their work still fell short of classical standards.


## 4.  The Pisan Renaissance: Buschetto and the Duomo

A significant shift is marked by the construction of Pisa's Duomo in 1016 under the direction of Buschetto, a Greek architect. Vasari praises Buschetto's ingenuity in incorporating salvaged classical columns and other materials into the innovative five-nave structure.  He includes the Latin inscription from Buschetto's tomb, "Quod vix mille boum possent juga juncta movere, / Et quod vix potuit per mare ferre ratis, Buschetti nisus, / Quod erat mirabile visu, / Dena puellarum turba levavit onus," illustrating the scale and marvel of the undertaking.


## 5.  Niccolà Pisano:  Master Sculptor and Architect

Vasari introduces Niccolà Pisano, a sculptor whose work marks a significant turning point. Inspired by ancient Roman sarcophagi (like the one depicting the Meleager hunt), Niccolà infused a classical sensibility into his sculptures. His work, including the tomb of St. Dominic and the pulpit of the Pisa Baptistery, are described as surpassing previous artistic styles and highlighting an increased emphasis on realism and expression. Vasari quotes Niccolà's inscription on the Pisa Baptistery pulpit: "Anno milleno bis centum bisque trideno / Hoc opus insigne sculpsit Nicola Pisanus."


## 6. Giovanni Pisano: Son and Artistic Successor

The life of Giovanni Pisano, Niccolà's son, is explored. Giovanni’s artistic prowess builds upon his father's achievements, becoming increasingly influential. His projects, including the pulpit of Siena Cathedral and the Campo Santo in Pisa, reveal his mastery of sculpture and his contributions to architectural design. Vasari notes Giovanni's increased emotional expression in his figures compared to his father's work and emphasizes the vast scope of his artistic output.


## 7. Cimabue: The Rebirth of Painting

Vasari then turns to painting, showcasing the pivotal role of Cimabue in its revival. Initially trained as a student of grammar, Cimabue's natural talent for drawing is noted. Observing Greek painters working in Florence, Cimabue eventually surpassed his instructors, moving away from the "rude Greek manner" and towards greater naturalism and improved realism. Vasari cites several of Cimabue's works in Florence and Assisi, highlighting his work in both tempera and fresco.  He also quotes Dante's _Purgatorio_ which mentions Cimabue's diminished fame in comparison to Giotto:  "Credette Cimabue nella pittura / Tener lo campo, ed hora ha Giotto il grido, / Si che la fama di colui s' oscura."


## 8. Giotto:  The Master and Innovator

Giotto, Cimabue's student, is presented as the true revolutionary figure in painting.  His early works are noted, followed by a detailed description of his frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua, showcasing Giotto's advancements in perspective, naturalism and emotional expression.  Vasari mentions the famous anecdote of Giotto's perfect circle drawn for Pope Benedict, which solidified Giotto's reputation for surpassing other contemporary painters.  Vasari  mentions Giotto’s frescoes in Assisi, noting his incorporation of realistic details and expressive figures.


## 9.  Andrea Tafi and Gaddo Gaddi: Masters of Mosaic and Painting

The lives of Andrea Tafi and Gaddo Gaddi illustrate the concurrent flourishing of mosaic art and painting.  Tafi, through his study of Greek techniques and the collaborative work on the mosaics of the Florence Baptistery, contributed to the improvement of mosaic work in Tuscany.  Vasari emphasizes the significance of Tafi's mosaics, even though some elements still showed roughness. Gaddo Gaddi, a friend of Cimabue, continued this legacy, refining the art of mosaic and leaving notable works in Florence, Rome, and Pisa. His mosaic work in the Duomo is highlighted for its exceptional quality and artistic merits.


## 10.  Other Notable Figures:  Expanding the Artistic Landscape

Vasari presents the lives of various other artists, including Margaritone of Arezzo, who is depicted as a less innovative painter and sculptor but still important for his contributions to techniques like using linen canvas on wood panels and applying Armenian bole. The lives of Stefano and Ugolino Sanese showcase the continuing evolution of painting, with Stefano's works illustrating greater realism and emotional depth than his predecessors. Pietro Laurati's frescoes and panel paintings in Siena and Arezzo demonstrate the influence of Giotto and the rise of naturalism in this area.  


## 11. Andrea Pisano: Bridging Sculpture and Architecture

Andrea Pisano's significance as a sculptor and architect is noted.  His bronze doors for the Florence Baptistery are highlighted as a major achievement, showing the improvement in artistic skill and moving away from earlier, coarser styles. His works in marble, including statues for the Florence Cathedral, show his understanding of the classical past. The text notes that his son Nino continued his legacy.


## 12. Buonamico Buffalmacco:  Humor and Artistic Skill

The life of Buonamico Buffalmacco, known for his humor as much as his art, is described through anecdotes from Boccaccio's *Decameron* and Sacchetti's *Three Hundred Tales*. His paintings are praised for their emotional intensity and inventiveness, even though his techniques and attention to detail were inconsistent. His paintings in Pisa and elsewhere are detailed, emphasizing his skill when he chose to focus on his work, even if this was infrequent.


## 13. Ambrogio Lorenzetti: Master of Narrative and Fresco

Ambrogio Lorenzetti, a Sienese painter, receives commendation for his inventive frescoes. Vasari highlights his work in the Church of the Friars Minor in Siena, praising his ability to depict emotion and the elements.  His skill in both fresco and tempera is noted,  along with the importance of his allegorical frescoes in the Palazzo Pubblico, illustrating the effects of Good and Bad Government. 


## 14. Pietro Cavallini: Roman Master, Giotto's Disciple

Pietro Cavallini, a Roman painter and disciple of Giotto, is presented as a significant figure in Rome's artistic revival.  Vasari emphasizes his skill in both fresco and mosaic, highlighting his major works in various Roman churches. His mastery of creating depth and relief in his figures is also praised.  His influence in reviving Roman painting is discussed and is considered one of Giotto's most notable pupils.


## 15. Simone Martini (Sanese):  Poet and Painter

The life of Simone Martini, a Sienese painter known for his elegance and grace, is detailed. The author emphasizes his connection to Petrarch, who immortalized Martini through his writings.  His works in Avignon, Siena, Florence, and Pisa are described, particularly focusing on his work in the Chapter House of Santa Maria Novella, which features portraits of Petrarch, Laura, and other notable figures.   


## 16. Taddeo Gaddi: Giotto's Legacy and Architectural Contributions

Taddeo Gaddi, Giotto’s most notable pupil, is described as a successful artist who improved upon Giotto's style while continuing his master's legacy. His frescoes in Santa Croce and other Florentine churches are detailed, and his role in major architectural projects like the Ponte Vecchio is highlighted. His management of the Orsanmichele is also mentioned, illustrating his contributions to the city.


## 17. Andrea di Cione Orcagna: A Multi-Talented Master

Andrea Orcagna's multifaceted career as a painter, sculptor, architect, and poet is explored.  His frescoes and sculptures are discussed in detail, highlighting his mastery in diverse artistic realms. His work on the Orsanmichele Tabernacle is considered a peak of Gothic art.   His major contributions to the city's architectural landscape are mentioned, particularly his role in the Loggia della Signoria, marking a significant advancement in architectural styles.


## 18. Tommaso (Giottino): Master of Shadows and Emotion

Tommaso, nicknamed Giottino, is presented as an innovative painter who focused on the expressive use of light and shadow. His works, although less abundant, are celebrated for their emotional intensity and refined technique. Vasari mentions his frescoes and panel paintings in several Florentine churches, emphasizing his artistic maturity and unique style.


## 19. Giovanni dal Ponte and Agnolo Gaddi:  Concluding the First Volume

The lives of Giovanni dal Ponte and Agnolo Gaddi conclude Volume 1.  Dal Ponte, a follower of Buffalmacco, is presented as a skilled but less ambitious artist whose works are less well-preserved. Agnolo Gaddi, son of Taddeo, is shown to have continued his family's artistic legacy but was eventually drawn to commerce more than painting.  The inclusion of these varied artists illustrates the wide range of artistic styles and personal trajectories during the early Renaissance.
