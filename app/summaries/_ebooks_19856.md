## A Study of Pueblo Architecture: Tusayan and Cibola - A Summary

### Creation Myths and Early Migrations

The book begins by exploring the creation myths of the Tusayan people, inhabitants of the region.  These myths consistently place the origin of humankind in the interior of the earth, with ascent to the current, fourth plane achieved through various magical means like climbing a cane or pine tree.  The myths emphasize the emergence of humanity through a single opening, a motif symbolized in kiva hatchways and various artistic designs. Following creation, the Hopituh (the Tusayan's self-designation) dispersed, migrating in separate groups from various directions. The Snake people are identified as the first inhabitants of Tusayan, with their migration detailed in a legend that describes them traveling towards a guiding star, building houses at various halts ("Wherever a bag dropped, there was their house."), ultimately settling near Wipho spring before Másauwu (earth god) compelled them to relocate to Walpi.

### The Arrival of Other Clans

Subsequent migrations brought the Horn people from a snow-covered, resource-rich land in the east (possibly the Rio Grande headwaters), initially settling in Canyon de Chelly ("A place where none but those who were of our people ever gained access.") before finally reaching Tusayan.  The Bear people followed, originating from the east and west, battling the Fire people at the Oval House ruin (Tebvwúki) before settling near Antelope Canyon. The Fire people eventually moved to Sikyátki, but were later massacred by the Walpi.  The Squash people arrived from the south, first building at Chukubi before relocating to Mashongnavi due to dwindling water sources.  Other clans, like the Burrowing Owl and Coyote, joined the Middle Mesa settlements.  The Eagle people migrated from the west via Moen-kopi, initially settling at Shi-tái-mu before integrating with the Snake people at Walpi.

### The Arrival of the Water People and the Hano

The Water people's legend details a catastrophic flood in their southern homeland (Palát Kwabi), resulting in a mass migration north.  They encountered the Sun people at Homólobi, and eventually reached Tusayan, where they faced conflict with the Walpi before settling at Mashongnavi and other villages.  The Asanyumu, originating from the Chama region in New Mexico, arrived via Awatubi after periods of settlement at various Rio Grande pueblos.  They built at Coyote Water before being incorporated into Walpi.

### The Hano (Tewa) and Intertribal Conflicts

The Hano (Tewa) people, of a different linguistic stock, migrated from seven villages along the Rio Grande.  They came to Tusayan after repeated requests by the Walpi, initially facing hostility before their integration.  The ensuing period was marked by various intertribal conflicts.  The feud between the Sikyátki and Walpi culminated in the destruction of Sikyátki and a similar conflict involving Awatubi, resulting in a violent assault and the village's destruction ("Every man and woman able to draw a bow or wield a weapon were got in readiness...").  These events are depicted with grim detail and showcase the brutality of inter-village warfare.  Further conflicts between Oraibi and Walpi occurred before a lasting peace was achieved.

### Pueblo Ruins: Architectural Evidence

The book moves on to describe the ruins of Tusayan and Cibola, emphasizing their limited architectural information. Many are low mounds of debris with few standing walls ("No trace of the numerous constructive details...").   However, the plans and topographic locations, especially when combined with traditions, provide valuable insights.  The Old Walpi mound is one example where only contour lines define the ruin’s extent. Old Mashongnavi reveals a more detailed plan, showing courts and irregularly placed houses reflecting the modern village.  Shitaimuvi exhibits plentiful pottery fragments similar to Awatubi ware, suggesting contemporaneity.  Awatubi reveals a more symmetrical plan than modern villages, with adobe fragments possibly representing mission buildings.

### Tusayan Ruins: Diverse Forms and Functions

The Horn House ruin closely follows the mesa edge, while the Bat House has a more irregular arrangement with a defensive wall (a unique feature among Hopi ruins). Mishiptonga, the largest Jeditoh ruin, is highly irregular, suggesting prolonged occupancy. Moen-kopi ruins display compact, well-made rooms built of thin sandstone slabs. The Oraibi Wash ruins are particularly noteworthy for their excellent masonry despite limited surviving walls. Kwaituki, another Oraibi Wash ruin, contains a cave once used for storage.  Tebugkihu (Fire House) stands out with massive stones in its remarkably preserved outer wall, representing a distinctly different construction style from most other Tusayan ruins.  Chukubi exhibits a rectangular plan with unequal courts and unusual excavations. Payupki, located on an isolated promontory, presents a symmetrical layout well-suited for defense, incorporating two kivas.

### Inhabited Villages of Tusayan: A Detailed Look

The book proceeds with detailed descriptions and plans of the inhabited Tusayan villages, highlighting their distinctive features.  Hano, a Tewa village, shows a less formal plan compared to the other Tusayan villages, with a partially preserved pyramidal cluster. Sichumovi features a long, irregular row of houses, similar to Hano, with a few small detached houses probably added by non-natives. Walpi shows the most irregularity, reflecting the uneven terrain, with kivas situated in less traditional locations due to the rocky site. Mashongnavi, built upon a rocky knoll, is compact yet irregular, with its growth illustrated through a series of diagrams detailing the addition of new house rows and courts over time. Shupaulovi, the smallest village, shows a clear open court, featuring covered passageways.  Shumopavi exhibits neatness and thrift, with plastered walls and frequent use of gypsum whitewash, indicating a relatively high level of maintenance.  Oraibi, the largest village, displays a large number of typical house rows with a remarkable uniformity of direction, despite its size. Moen-kopi, a smaller farming settlement, shows more recent construction, built over the remains of an older village.

### Inhabited Villages of Cibola: Contrasting Architectural Styles

The book moves on to the inhabited villages of Cibola, focusing on their plans and characteristics. Nutria, a small farming pueblo, shows a compact arrangement with some features suggesting an older core, resembling Kin-tiel's form. Pescado, a larger farming pueblo, closely follows the outline of an older village, showing a larger court. Ojo Caliente, situated near the remains of the Seven Cities, shows more recent construction, with houses distributed across varied terrain, indicative of a more relaxed approach to defense.  Zuñi, the largest and most significant pueblo, developed around the remains of Halona, displaying a dense clustering of dwellings in older sections, while newer sections are more loosely arranged.  The numerous oblique openings illustrate a solution to the lighting problems created by the dense packing of buildings.

### Constructional Details: Walls, Roofs, and Floors

The chapter on constructional details begins by comparing the walls of Tusayan and Cibola pueblos. Tusayan walls often show a sparser use of mud mortar than Zuñi walls, leading to greater exposure of masonry.  Zuñi walls are more frequently plastered over adobe, obscuring the underlying construction.  Both regions use similar techniques, such as chinking stones to achieve a smoother wall surface, although Zuñi frequently incorporates pottery fragments into adobe to reduce erosion.  Pueblo roofs and floors are intrinsically linked, with upper floors serving as lower roofs.  Roof construction typically involves layers of beams, poles, twigs, grass, and finally earth. Tusayan roofs sometimes feature clumsy masonry piers supporting girders, while Zuñi roofs, often better organized, sometimes employ split poles or even wooden shingles.

### Constructional Details: Copings, Ladders, and Steps

Wall copings are crucial for protecting roofs and walls from erosion. Tusayan often uses flush copings, while Zuñi frequently employs projecting copings or cornices.  Roof drains, absent in the ruins, are a prominent feature in modern pueblos, showcasing a variety of designs using stone or wood. Ladders, once primarily defensive, are now used more commonly for maintenance and access in both regions.  Tusayan retains a stronger preference for stone steps over ladders for upper terraces, while Zuñi frequently utilizes ladders supplemented by elaborate crosspieces to enhance stability.  Stone steps in Tusayan, often added after houses, frequently demonstrate a lack of planning.

### Constructional Details: Cooking, Fireplaces, and Gateways

The book describes cooking devices, ranging from simple cooking pits in Tusayan (with examples of more elaborate pi-gummi ovens) to the dome-shaped ovens common in Cibola.  Fireplaces evolved from simple pits to more complex hooded structures, with Tusayan showing a greater diversity of designs compared to the more standardized Zuñi chimneys.  Gateways, once prominent defensive features, are now largely replaced by passages formed from the crowding of houses.  Zuñi, however, still retains more distinctly defensive gateways, while Tusayan often shows traces of covered passages.

### Constructional Details: Doors, Windows, and Roof Openings

Doors are another prominent feature, ranging from simple openings to paneled wooden doors, with Zuñi exhibiting more sophisticated carpentry.  The small size of many openings, both doors and windows, is linked to both defensive needs and the lack of effective means of closure.  Windows often blur the line with doorways, frequently being small and framed in stone or wood.  Zuñi uses selenite slabs, a likely post-Spanish innovation, for window glazing.  Roof openings serve for access and ventilation, with Zuñi showcasing oblique openings, a unique solution for lighting inner rooms in densely packed clusters, and a complex trapdoor system in kivas. Tusayan kivas, on the other hand, typically utilize a single opening for access and ventilation.  The book concludes by emphasizing the gradual shift from densely clustered, defensively designed villages to more dispersed settlements reflecting changing social and security dynamics within the Pueblo communities.
