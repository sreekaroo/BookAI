# L'Illustration, No. 3673, July 19, 1913: A Summary

## Parisian Musings by the Seine

The issue opens with a poignant essay, "Au Bord de l'Eau" ("By the Water's Edge"), by Henri Lavedan.  The author describes a melancholic Sunday spent by the Seine, reflecting on the peculiar blend of subdued gaiety and underlying sadness found in such riverside leisure spots. He masterfully captures the atmosphere:  "Temps d'hôpital, qui me ouate le coeur... temps soucieux, réfléchi, temps chagrin, temps qui pense et qui fait penser, temps de cendre où les nuages, en composant un autre ciel, ne remplacent pas le vrai qu'ils voilent." (Hospital time, which pads my heart... anxious, thoughtful, sad time, time that thinks and makes you think, ashy time where clouds, composing another sky, do not replace the true one they veil.). The imagery of the scene, including the leaning poplar trees reflected in the water and the dilapidated, empty boats, evokes a sense of wistful nostalgia and the fleeting nature of youth. The author connects this atmosphere to the works of Daudet and Maupassant, who similarly explored these "louches et suaves" (murky and sweet) sensations.

## The Grand Military Review of July 14th

The article shifts to a vivid account of the July 14th military review at Longchamp.  The author emphasizes the immense patriotic fervor displayed by the Parisian crowd, estimated at 400,000 to 500,000 people.  The review featured a diverse array of troops, including metropolitan and colonial units, creating "un pittoresque inédit" (unprecedented picturesqueness). President Poincaré's distribution of flags and the awarding of the Legion of Honour to the 1st Senegalese Regiment are highlighted as moments of intense national pride and unity. The author contrasts this overwhelming display of patriotism with the "dix ou quinze mille égarés ou indécis" (ten or fifteen thousand misguided or undecided) who protested against the event.  The descriptions paint a scene of joyous national unity and military strength.

##  Celebrating the Colonial Troops

A substantial portion of the article focuses on the colonial troops' participation, particularly the Senegalese, Indochinese, and other African soldiers. Their presence brought a unique spectacle and captivated the Parisian public, drawing attention to their "silhouettes pittoresques et leurs attitudes martiales" (picturesque silhouettes and martial attitudes).  The article details the events organized in their honor, including a reception at the Cercle du Soldat and a parade through Paris, during which their music, the "nouba," resonated through the streets, evoking a triumphant atmosphere. The inclusion of several photographs underscores the visual impact of these diverse troops.

## The Pyrenees Road Project

A new initiative by the Touring-Club is introduced: the development of the "Route des Pyrénées" (Pyrenees Road). The project aims to connect Hendaye and Cape Cerbere, traversing diverse and scenic landscapes. The article mentions the involvement of the Compagnie du Midi, which is launching bus services along the route, and the electrification of the Pyrenean railway network, facilitated by a new hydroelectric plant in Soulom. This section showcases the plans for enhancing tourism in the relatively unexplored areas of the Pyrenees.

## The Unknown Pyrenees and Saint-Martin-du-Canigou Abbey

The article moves on to highlight the "Pyrénées inconnues" (unknown Pyrenees), particularly focusing on Font-Romeu and its connection to bus services towards Ax-les-Thermes and Quillan.  Of particular interest is the mention of Saint-Martin-du-Canigou Abbey, an 11th-century monastery-fortress restored by Bishop de Carsalade du Pont.  The description of the abbey's picturesque location and the bishop's dedication to tourism adds a spiritual and historical dimension to the account, portraying a blend of religious heritage and modern tourism development.

## Defending the Foreign Legion

The article then addresses recent German press attacks on the French Foreign Legion, specifically addressing a fabricated story of an executed German legionnaire.  The article provides a factual rebuttal, clarifying that a Swiss, not a German, legionnaire was executed three years prior due to desertion and incitement to desertion, and that Colonel Pierron was not involved. The author underscores the absurdity of the German claims and reiterates the Legion's honorable history and the diverse backgrounds of its members.  A quote from M. Candau-Maurer emphasizes the Legion's role as "le lieu de refuge où tant de malheureux égarés ont pu se refaire une vie honorable" (a place of refuge where many unfortunate lost souls have been able to rebuild an honorable life).

## Organization and Recruitment of the Foreign Legion

The article provides a detailed account of the Foreign Legion's organization and recruitment.  It explains the distinction between serving under "titre étranger" (foreign status) and "titre français" (French status), emphasizing that many French citizens serve under foreign status.  The recruitment process for both French and foreign nationals is detailed, including age limits, engagement durations, and the conditions for re-engagement. The article also explains the evolution of benefits and rights for legionnaires.  The complexities of the Legion's rules and regulations are thoroughly discussed.

## The Diverse Legionnaires

Several photographs illustrate the diverse nationalities of the legionnaires, ranging from Germans and Austrians to Swiss, Italians, and others. The article highlights the remarkable blend of backgrounds and social classes within the legion, citing anecdotes from General Bruneau's experiences, including an encounter with a bishop serving as a legionnaire and the case of a legionnaire who unexpectedly inherited a large fortune.  This section paints a picture of the human element within the Legion’s rigorous military framework.

##  Nocturnal Paris during the July 14th Celebrations

The article includes a photographic glimpse of the July 14th celebrations in Paris.  The image depicts a lively street scene with merry-go-rounds and dancing amidst the celebrations. This serves as a visual contrast to the more serious and somber tone of some of the other sections of the publication, offering a brief moment of lightheartedness.

##  The Balkan War and Correspondents' Reports

The final sections cover the Balkan War, reporting on the sudden Bulgarian attack on Greek and Serbian forces.  The articles include excerpts from letters written by correspondents Jean Leune in Athens and Alain de Penennrun in Serbian Macedonia.  Leune describes the initial confusion and rapid developments in Athens, highlighting the diplomatic efforts of Venizelos and the mobilization of Greek forces.  Penennrun's report details the fierce fighting between Serbian and Bulgarian troops, emphasizing the intensity and high casualties of the conflict.  Both reports provide firsthand accounts of the war's unfolding events.  The article concludes with accounts of additional gains by the Greeks and Serbians.  Reports end with a discussion of the Bulgarian atrocities and the progress of the war, showcasing the ongoing battle and its significant implications.
