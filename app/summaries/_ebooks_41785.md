## Archaic England: A Summary in Chronological Paragraphs

**I.  A Multidisciplinary Approach to Prehistory:**

Harold Bayley's "Archaic England" departs from conventional archaeological methods, employing a "jigsaw system" to piece together prehistory from diverse sources: history, folklore, mythology, symbolism, numismatics, and etymology.  He acknowledges the inherent risks of such a broad approach, comparing his undertaking to the frustratingly incomplete history project of his acquaintance, Charles Templeton.  Bayley's aim is to weave together seemingly disparate facts, recognizing that "what Authority maintains to-day it generally contradicts tomorrow," and that established theories, such as the Asiatic origin of Aryan civilization, are often overturned by new discoveries.  He states his purpose is not to champion any specific theory (like the Atlantean theory), but to present a cohesive body of evidence.


**II. The Enduring Power of Place-Names:**

Bayley argues that place-names offer invaluable insights into prehistory, often surviving conquests and societal shifts. He provides examples like Damascus, Hebron, and Mycenae, whose names endure despite significant historical events.  He criticizes modern place-name studies for relying on conjecture ("Hacca's burn or brook"), and proposes a more nuanced approach. He uses examples like Kimball/Cunebal (connected to King Cymbeline), and Iffley (possibly linked to the May Queen), to demonstrate the inherent poetic and symbolic elements often overlooked by purely linguistic analyses.  He highlights the significance of the Royal Commission's findings in Wales and Monmouthshire, which emphasize the value of farm and field names for uncovering prehistoric information.


**III. Echoes of Troy in British Traditions:**

Bayley explores the persistent tradition of Trojan origins for the British people. He cites Welsh bardic poems that refer to the "original colonists" arriving from "the city of Gafiz" in Asia, possessing "skill" and being "the dread of Europe". While acknowledging the legendary aspects of Brutus's arrival at Totnes, he connects it with similar traditions of maritime migration, citing Layamon's account of Hengist and Horsa's arrival. This theory is further supported by the prevalence of "Troy Town" names, the use of the word "tre" (dwelling) in Cornwall, and the presence of turf mazes, linked to Trojan games and traditions. This section moves beyond the limited view of Phoenician influence, focusing on a broader Aegean origin. 


**IV.  The Minoan Connection and Undated Coinage:**

Bayley connects the absence of Phoenician artifacts in Britain with the suggestion that Cretan sea traders were the primary maritime connections during the relevant periods. He then discusses the importance of pre-Roman British coinage, noting its advanced characteristics and its unique presence primarily in England. He challenges the conventional view that these coins are degraded imitations of Macedonian originals, highlighting the diversity and sophistication of their designs. These designs, he argues, reflect national ideas rather than mere carelessness. The coins themselves become a form of "prehistoric literature expressed in hieroglyphics."


**V.  Symbolism, Folklore, and the Persistence of Custom:**

Bayley emphasizes the significance of symbolism, folklore, and the enduring power of custom in understanding prehistory. He argues that many saint stories are Christianized versions of prehistoric myths, with pagan divinities seamlessly transformed into Christian saints. The Church's tactic of converting pagan sites and symbols, rather than destroying them, is discussed as a key factor in the survival of ancient beliefs. He cites the continued practice of pagan ceremonials in Normandy, Brittany, and even Spain as evidence of the resilience of folk memory and the difficulty of eradicating deeply ingrained traditions. This observation is connected to the "immortality of custom" and the persistent sanctity of pagan sites, shown in ongoing traditions like the Palm Sunday procession to Silbury Hill.


**VI.  The Magic of Words and the Limitations of Modern Etymology:**

Bayley criticizes modern etymology's disregard for the poetic and symbolic elements of language, contrasting it with his own multidisciplinary approach. He refutes the "disease of language" theory of Max Müller, arguing that words often originated from symbolic ideas, rather than the reverse. He details his methodology, which focuses on identifying original ideas expressed by words, highlighting the interchangeability of certain consonants and the relative unimportance of vowels in early language.  He uses the examples of words like “psyche” (butterfly/soul) and “John” (related to “giant,” “chien,” and “sun”) to support his claims.  Bayley criticizes mainstream etymological approaches as often "clumsy and frequently wrong," lacking explanations for the roots of words.


**VII.  The Figure of Albion: A Symbol of the All-Good:**

Bayley analyzes the name Albion, challenging the simplistic "white cliffs" interpretation. He proposes that the prefix "Alb" is connected to words like “pa” (feeder, father), and "alp" (high, rock), symbolizing the unchanging High Father.  Albion, therefore, becomes a symbol of the "All-Good" and “All-Well," linked through the interchangeability of consonants (b/p) to terms like "papa" (Pope), and to the All-Feeder aspect of the deity. The association of Albion with the many-breasted Mama Allpa of Peru further strengthens this interpretation. This section weaves together etymology with symbolism and mythology to paint a picture of Albion as a benevolent deity.


**VIII. Gog and Magog: Troglodytes and Tribal Emblems:**

Bayley examines the legendary figures of Gog and Magog, linking them to traditions of giants inhabiting Britain, and exploring their possible connection to various sites and names.  He connects them to the troglodytes of antiquity and the persistent traditions of giants, citing the Gogmagog hills, the rocks at Land's End, and biblical references to Gog and Magog. He observes the role of Gog and Magog in civic pageantry and explores the possible connections between their names and terms like "goggle," "giglet," and "gigantic," linking these to other giant figures in British and European folklore. He suggests that Gog represents the "High-High," or the Most High, and Magog the "Mother Most High.”


**IX. The Trojan Horse and the Persistence of Pagan Customs:**

Bayley examines the legend of the Trojan Horse, arguing that it might have a basis in fact rather than pure myth. The elaborate rituals and ceremonies associated with these "games" are considered, with quotations from Virgil's _Æneid_, demonstrating the level of detail and importance given to such rituals. The "Troy Games" and "Troy Town" names, including turf mazes, are viewed as tangible remnants of these traditions, spanning centuries and extending even to modern children's games.  The intertwining of Trojan and Tyrian identities in Virgil's work and in Welsh bardic traditions strengthens this line of argument.

**X.  Oberon and the Archaic Roots of British Law and Culture:**

Bayley delves into the figure of Oberon, tracing his name and associations to various sources, including possible connections to the British kingly line, the early names of Cornwall, and the prevalence of the word "Tre" (dwelling). This analysis connects Oberon to the broader concept of leadership, law, and order, linking terms like "druid," "deri" (wise man), and "true" to a common root.  He then examines the persistence of pre-Christian customs and beliefs, citing specific examples of festivals and traditions that have survived into the modern era, often blending with or overlaying Christian practices. The intertwining of pagan and Christian elements is viewed as a significant aspect of British cultural development. 


**XI. Unraveling the Symbolism of British Coins and Emblems:**

Bayley's analysis extends to the intricate symbolism and design of ancient British coins. He challenges the conventional view that these are mere crude imitations of Macedonian coins, arguing instead that their intricate designs are meaningful and reflect deeply embedded beliefs.  The prevalence of horses, birds, wheels, and crosses on these coins is explored, with links to wider Celtic and pre-Christian symbolism.  The coins are viewed not as "degraded imitations" but as carriers of significant cultural and religious information, requiring careful analysis rather than dismissal.


**XII. The Fairy Faith and the Intertwining of Pagan and Christian Traditions:**

The persistence of the fairy faith in Britain is highlighted as a significant factor in understanding the continuity of pre-Christian beliefs.  Bayley argues that the "fairy faith" was too deeply ingrained to be completely eradicated by Christianity, which instead absorbed and adapted many of these traditions into its own framework. This section emphasizes the subtle ways pagan beliefs were integrated into Christian practice, often with a merging of festivals and locations. The analysis of various "saints' lives" as Christianized versions of earlier myths demonstrates the power of pre-existing belief systems to influence subsequent ones. This influence remains observable in the ongoing traditions of the "good people" in British folklore.


**XIII. The Significance of Megalithic Monuments and the Search for Atlantis:**

Bayley considers the construction of the remarkable megalithic monuments in Britain, questioning the dominant interpretations.  The scale and sophistication of Avebury and Stonehenge are discussed, challenging the simplistic classification of these sites as mere sepulchral monuments. He questions how such massive stones were transported and erected, posing the larger question of whether these sites served additional intellectual and religious purposes.  This leads to a discussion of the legend of Atlantis, linking it to the possibility of widespread maritime migrations and a scientifically advanced, seafaring culture that predates recorded history. The enduring tradition of a lost island is seen as a potential link between seemingly disparate cultures and monuments around the world.


**XIV. Deep-Seated Traditions and a Broader View of History:**

Bayley concludes by emphasizing the need for a more holistic and less Eurocentric approach to studying prehistory. He urges a greater consideration of surviving folklore, traditions, and place-names, arguing that they contain crucial information overlooked by traditional historical and archaeological methods. He highlights the contributions of researchers who have challenged established theories and expanded the scope of inquiry.  The importance of considering a broader array of evidence and adopting a more sympathetic, less dismissive approach to seemingly "preposterous" traditions is the central theme of the book's conclusion. He implicitly argues for acknowledging a more complex and continuous history of human civilization in Britain than is typically presented.
