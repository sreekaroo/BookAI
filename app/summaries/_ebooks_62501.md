# Great Zimbabwe: A Chronological Summary

This summary organizes the provided text chronologically, detailing R.N. Hall's findings during his two-year examination of Great Zimbabwe.


## Arrival and First Impressions

In May 1902, Hall arrived in Victoria, Mashonaland, and journeyed to Great Zimbabwe.  Unlike Theodore Bent's arduous 1891 journey, Hall benefited from an improved road, arriving at midday. He established Havilah Camp near the ruins, noting the striking beauty of the Elliptical Temple, described as "one of Nature’s most perfect chromographs!" with its "bright orange and red, lemon-black, sea-green, and pale delicate yellow" colorings. His initial impressions were of awe and reverence, noting the presence of owls and snakes, symbolic of a desecrated temple, yet acknowledging the advanced scientific and astronomical knowledge reflected in the ruins.  The stark contrast between the notice forbidding unauthorized digging and the majestic ruins themselves is pointedly observed.


## Exploring the Elliptical Temple

Hall's Sunday morning exploration of the Elliptical Temple prompted reflections on the continuity between ancient Semitic faiths and modern Christianity. He noted the massive walls as eloquent of a "dead religion" yet significant in the evolution of religious thought, highlighting the "thoroughness and devotion" evident in the temple's construction.  The author contemplated the temple's purpose, mentioning Baal and Astoroth as divinities and the abundance of phalli. A midnight visit during a full moon illuminated the temple's mystical aspect, heightening the feeling of being in "forbidden precincts." Hall contrasted the daytime and nighttime experiences of the temple, emphasizing the dramatic effect of moonlight on the ruins. He pondered the temple's design, noting its skyward orientation and the likely significance of the moon and stars visible within the walls to the temple's builders.


##  Excavation at the Elliptical Temple: Early Discoveries

The author describes his labor force consisting of Makalanga men who worked diligently under the eye of their overseer, M’Guti. Their work habits and daily routines are detailed, from early morning roll call to the rhythmic sounds of their work chants. Their innate curiosity and penchant for distractions, often related to snake sightings and games like _isafuba_ (a game with fascinating similarities to chess and draughts), are highlighted.  The discovery of a modern clay pipe and a soda-water bottle at significant depths humorously illustrated the multiple layers of occupation and excavation undertaken over the centuries. The regular meetings with Chief Mogabe and his headmen to discuss discovered artifacts are also described. Mogabe's consistent requests for salt and tobacco in exchange for knowledge emphasize the socioeconomic dynamic.


## The Acropolis: A Fortress of Stone


The Acropolis, or Hill Fortress, is presented as a marvel of engineering and defensive architecture. Hall recounts climbing the 230-foot ascent and entering the complex passages.  The commanding view from the top, encompassing the Elliptical Temple, the "Valley of Ruins," and the surrounding landscape, is meticulously described, highlighting its strategic importance.  The author also describes the sunset and moonlight views, which created a "sense of intense loneliness and solitude." He discusses the natives' beliefs in spirits inhabiting the ruins after sunset, attributing their fear to past experiences of tribal warfare.


##  The Elliptical Temple: Detailed Architectural Analysis


Hall presents a detailed analysis of the Elliptical Temple's architecture. He notes the elliptical plan, similar to temples in ancient Arabia, and the differences in the quality of construction between the east and west walls.  He details measurements, including the circumference of the walls and the battering of the walls. The unique Chevron pattern, interpreted as a symbol of fertility, is analyzed in its context of location and design. The importance of drains throughout the structure is emphasized, with numerous examples provided. The author uses the evidence gathered in his excavations to cast doubt on the monolithic status of several previously considered pillars.


## Relics and Finds: Illuminating the Past

The chapter details the discovery of numerous relics, focusing on their locations and associations. The abundance and recurring patterns of artifacts like phalli, soapstone beams, bowls, and birds are highlighted as evidence of specific cultural practices. The presence of gold in various forms (beads, plates, tacks, etc.) is analyzed, establishing a distinction between ancient goldwork and later native creations. The importance of copper articles (sheathing, spearheads, bangles) and iron tools (hoes, picks, chisels) is also discussed, and these were all located on different levels. The discovery of Arabian glass and pottery with Post-Koranic lettering and other imports in various layers of the ruins helps to establish a timeline.  Special attention is given to the “finds” of gold scorifiers, emphasizing their cultural origin and revealing their composition through Dr. Hahn’s analysis.


## Architectural Features: A Deeper Look


Hall presents a detailed examination of various architectural elements in Great Zimbabwe. He further discusses the durability of walls and the causes of dilapidation, attributing it to natural forces (rain, wind) and human actions. The author distinguishes between ancient walls and those constructed by later Makalanga inhabitants, highlighting differences in construction techniques and materials. The presence of Makalanga huts within the ruins, with different types and associated artifacts, supports his claims regarding the later occupation. The study of passages is enhanced by Hall's excavation of significant lengths of passages, emphasizing their function as communication routes and components of the defensive system.   


##  The Sacred Enclosure and Conical Tower

The Sacred Enclosure, containing the iconic Conical Tower and a smaller ruined tower, is explored in detail. The author provides measurements and discusses the construction techniques of the Conical Tower. He refutes claims of earlier discoveries of "treasure chambers," citing the consistent results of excavations revealing the tower to be solid.  The dentelle pattern, and its degradation due to tree growth, receives careful attention. The purpose of the smaller tower, its possible significance, and its relation to similar structures elsewhere are discussed, drawing heavily on Bent's work. The Parallel Passage, leading from the North Entrance to the Sacred Enclosure, is described in detail. Its narrowness and lack of connection to other sections of the temple reinforce the suggestion that it was a restricted area used by priests.


## Other Structures: Enclosures, Platforms, and Ascents

Hall systematically describes various enclosures within the Elliptical Temple, providing measurements, details of construction, and associated findings.  The significance of Platforms, often positioned near Conical Towers, is discussed.  The chapter covers the Inner Parallel Passage, the South Passage, and the West Passage, emphasizing their layout and purpose, and noting differences in construction suggesting multiple occupancy periods.  The study of the North-East Passage links the Elliptical Temple with the Valley of Ruins, highlighting the complex interconnectedness of the site's architecture.  The exploration of the Acropolis is also further discussed.


##  The Valley of Ruins: Posselt, Philips, Maund, Renders, and Mauch Ruins

The "Valley of Ruins" is explored, focusing on the Posselt, Philips, Maund, Renders, and Mauch Ruins, and the author's findings. Hall categorizes the ruins into three sections (lower, middle, and upper), highlighting differences in construction quality and the types of relics found. Each ruin's unique features, including entrances, passages, and other architectural details, are meticulously described, with special attention paid to the finds within the ruins.  Hall further analyzes the quality of construction, noting the prevalence of the rounded architectural style in the older ruins and highlighting evidence of both ancient and Makalanga occupations.  He presents strong arguments against the “ancient” status of some ruins, yet accepts the “ancient” status of others.


## Conclusion: Preserving the Legacy

The work concludes with a summary of Hall's conclusions regarding the architecture, age, and probable builders of Great Zimbabwe. The author emphasizes the importance of ongoing preservation efforts, acknowledging the contributions of officials like Sir W. H. Milton.  He expresses gratitude to various individuals for their support and contribution to his research, closing with a reiteration of the vastness of the site and the potential for future discoveries.  The book's dedication to Theodore Bent's memory underscores the historical significance of the ongoing research.  The text emphasizes the collaborative nature of the research and the importance of interdisciplinary contributions to understand the site's complex history.
