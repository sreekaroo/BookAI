# Men of the Old Stone Age: A Chronological Summary

Here's a chronological summary of Henry Fairfield Osborn's *Men of the Old Stone Age*, exceeding 10% of the original text length, divided into detailed paragraphs:

## 1. Ancient Conceptions and the Dawn of Anthropology

Osborn begins by contrasting ancient Greek conceptions of humanity's origins (as expressed by Lucretius, Horace, and Æschylus) with the later Mosaic account of special creation.  These Greek views, while poetic, surprisingly foreshadowed many aspects of modern understanding of human evolution, including man's early physical robustness, dependence on hunting and gathering, discovery of fire and clothing, and gradual societal development. Lucretius, for instance, vividly describes early man's life, noting, "Things throughout proceed/In firm, undevious order... Yet man's first sons... were hardier far;/Strong built with ampler bones..." This early recognition of a natural history of man laid the groundwork for the later scientific investigation.  The 16th and 17th centuries saw the rise of comparative anatomy, fueled by accounts of apes, leading to serious comparisons between apes and humans, laying the foundation for evolutionary thinking.  Buffon and Lamarck were crucial figures, with Lamarck boldly proposing descent from apes, highlighting the importance of bipedalism and social life in human evolution.


## 2. Early Discoveries and the Neanderthal Revelation

The early 19th century witnessed significant discoveries of caveman artifacts in France and Belgium, establishing the geologic antiquity of man. Schmerling's work in Belgium, published in 1833-4, provided the first published evidence of the Cave Period, showcasing the association of human bones and tools with extinct animals like the mammoth and cave-bear.  This spurred further research and led to the science of archaeology.   In 1856, the Neanderthal discovery near Düsseldorf marked a turning point, as Schaaffhausen recognized it as a primitive, extinct human type, showcasing "a primitive race of low cerebral development and of uncommon bodily strength."  Darwin's *Origin of Species* (1858) implicitly acknowledged the relevance of his theory to human origins, while Lyell's *Geological Evidences of the Antiquity of Man* (1863) explicitly linked the Neanderthal finds to Lamarck's evolutionary ideas, arguing that the Neanderthal skull exemplified "a less advanced stage of progressive development."


## 3. Archæological Frameworks and the Palæolithic Periods

Boucher de Perthes's discoveries in the Somme Valley (1839-1846) revealed the much older "river-drift" man of the Lower Palæolithic, initially met with skepticism until confirmed by others.  This era, characterized by chipped stone tools like the hand-axe, was contrasted with the later, polished stone tools of the Neolithic. Lubbock's classification of the prehistoric period into the Iron, Bronze, Neolithic, and Palæolithic ages provided a crucial framework. Lartet's work in the Pyrenees and Dordogne (from 1860) unveiled the Upper Palæolithic, particularly the Aurignacian culture, distinguished by bone tools and early art. Lartet and Christy's *Reliquiæ Aquitanicæ* documented this rich period, with Lartet recognizing distinct stages based on fauna.  De Mortillet's systematic approach to the flint industry further refined the chronological sequence, although initially omitting the Aurignacian, only later integrated by Breuil, establishing the chronological order of Chellean, Acheulean, Mousterian, Aurignacian, Solutrean, and Magdalenian.


## 4. Geologic Time and the Multiple Ice Age

Osborn emphasizes the importance of understanding the geologic context of human evolution within the Pleistocene Epoch (Ice Age).  The initial understanding of a single glacial advance gave way to the recognition of multiple glacial and interglacial stages, with Geikie proposing as many as six glacial periods. Penck and Brückner's research on Alpine glaciation strongly supported a model of four major glaciations (Günz, Mindel, Riss, Würm), establishing a crucial chronological framework for dating human remains and cultures. Osborn adopts a more conservative estimate of 520,000 years for the entire Ice Age, with the Old Stone Age spanning the latter quarter. The text highlights the use of river terraces and loess deposits as tools for dating, emphasizing the need to distinguish between original terrace formation and subsequent deposition on those terraces.


## 5. Pliocene Environments and the Trinil Ape-Man

Osborn describes the Pliocene Epoch, preceding the Pleistocene, as a time of warm, temperate climate in Europe, similar to the mid-US today.  The Pliocene flora included trees like sassafras and cypress, while the fauna comprised various mammals with Asiatic and African affinities, like hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and primitive horses and cattle.   The absence of anthropoid apes in the European Pliocene suggests their evolution may have primarily occurred in Asia.  The discovery of *Pithecanthropus erectus* (the Trinil ape-man) in Java highlights this possibility. Dubois, its discoverer, described it as a transitional form, noting, "He is the ancestor of man."   The text discusses debate over its age (late Pliocene or early Pleistocene), and its features (low forehead, prominent brow ridges, and a femur suggesting bipedalism) placing it as a significant pre-human stage.


## 6. Early Pleistocene Life and the Heidelberg Jaw

The Early Pleistocene saw the continued migration of mammals into Europe, with the First Interglacial period showing a warmer climate than present.  The absence of anthropoid apes in Europe at this time, coupled with the existence of early primates and the still debated question of early flint tools (eoliths), emphasizes the possible origin of human ancestors in Asia.  The Second Glaciation marks another significant period of environmental change.   The Second Interglacial Stage is where the Heidelberg jaw was found. Schoetensack identified the Heidelberg jaw (_Homo heidelbergensis_) as the "first true species of man" found in Europe. It exhibited features like a receding chin, large jaw, and human-like teeth.  The associated fauna indicated a temperate climate, challenging earlier ideas of a tropical climate during the Second Interglacial.


## 7. The Rise of Neanderthal Culture: Mousterian Tools and Cave Life

The Third Glaciation led to colder conditions, but the ensuing Third Interglacial stage witnessed the arrival of Pre-Chellean flint workers and the Piltdown man in western Europe.  The text emphasizes debate around the Piltdown man’s age (early vs. late Pleistocene), placing it within the Third Interglacial, making it a relatively late Pleistocene hominid.  The Fourth Glaciation brought about significant environmental shifts. The Neanderthal race developed during this period, characterized by a distinct Mousterian industry and increasing cave dwelling. Osborn discusses the challenges of dating this era, noting that “high terraces” often contain later deposits, and highlighting the significance of loess deposits in tracing arid periods.


## 8. Neanderthal Anatomy and the Mousterian Industry

Osborn provides a detailed description of Neanderthal anatomy, drawing from discoveries at various sites (Gibraltar, Neanderthal, Spy, La Chapelle-aux-Saints, Krapina, etc.). Key features include prominent brow ridges, receding forehead, projecting jaw, short stature, and a relatively large cranial capacity despite a comparatively primitive brain structure.  Osborn contrasts this with the anatomy of modern humans and other hominids. The Mousterian industry, associated with the Neanderthals, is described as a refinement of Acheulean technology, but without significant innovation. It relies heavily on the retouched flake, with the hand-axe declining in importance. Osborn discusses theories of Neanderthal culture and practices (hunting, cave life, possible cannibalism), emphasizing their limitations in technology compared to later humans.


## 9. The Arrival of Homo Sapiens: The Crô-Magnon Revolution

The end of the Neanderthal era marks a major shift in European prehistory. Osborn describes the arrival of *Homo sapiens*—specifically, the Crô-Magnon race—a physically and intellectually superior group.  The Grimaldi race, discovered in the Grotte des Enfants, is introduced as a distinct negroid group in the transition period, though their long-term influence remains uncertain.  The Crô-Magnon culture, associated with the Aurignacian industry, is characterized by advanced toolmaking, the advent of art (engravings, sculpture, and the first indications of painting), and sophisticated burial practices, contrasting sharply with the Neanderthals. Osborn highlights the debate over Crô-Magnon origins (southward migration along the Mediterranean), and emphasizes the striking advances in their technology and art.


## 10. Upper Paleolithic Art and the Magdalenian Climax

Osborn traces the evolution of Upper Paleolithic art, focusing on its chronological development and geographical distribution. Aurignacian art, with its early engravings and sculptures, progresses through the Solutrean (which features a peak in flint-working but a relative decline in art), and culminates in the Magdalenian. The Magdalenian period (16,000-10,000 B.C.) shows a decline in flint-working but a remarkable flourishing of bone and antler carving, along with highly developed painting and engraving within caves. Osborn examines various cave art sites (Font-de-Gaume, Altamira, Combarelles, Niaux, etc.) demonstrating the mastery of realistic animal depictions, often involving polychrome techniques and subtle use of perspective and light.  He highlights the artistic skill and close observation of animals, along with the mysteries surrounding the selection of cave locations and the possible symbolic meanings of the art.


## 11. The Azilian-Tardenoisian Transition and the Neolithic Dawn

The Azilian-Tardenoisian culture, marking the close of the Upper Paleolithic, represents a significant shift. This era is characterized by the decline of sophisticated art, with a simpler, more schematic style appearing on painted pebbles, and by the prevalence of smaller tools, especially the microliths of the Tardenoisian tradition. Osborn examines the geographic distribution of this culture, highlighting its connections with the south Mediterranean.   The Ofnet burials in Bavaria reveal the presence of broad-headed and long-headed races at this time, suggesting an influx of new populations. The text concludes with a discussion of the transition to the Neolithic period, emphasizing the appearance of polished stone tools, agriculture, pottery, and the domestication of animals, showcasing a fundamental change in human life and economic activity.  The Campignian is presented as a potentially transitional stage. Finally, Osborn explores the origins and relationships of various Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic races, suggesting multiple migratory waves from Eurasia and the Mediterranean, with some possible persistence of Crô-Magnon traits in modern European populations.
