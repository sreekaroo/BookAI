## Up To Date Business: A Summary

### I. Defining Commerce and Business Terminology

The book begins by differentiating between "commerce" (the exchange of goods between countries or regions) and "business" (dealings within a town or city).  It establishes that in the United States, "trade" is synonymous with "business," while "traffic" refers to the movement of goods.  Key terms like merchandise, goods, wares, gross, and net are defined, highlighting the distinction between total amounts (gross) and amounts after deductions (net).  The concepts of "firm," "house," and "concern" are explained as interchangeable terms referring to business entities. Finally, the meaning and usage of "market" are explored, including its application to specific goods and the overall economic climate ("the money market is tight").


### II.  Understanding Wholesale and Retail Trade

The text proceeds to discuss a nation's natural resources and their role in establishing commercial centers.  The functions of commission merchants and selling agents are clarified.  A crucial distinction is made between wholesale (selling to other dealers) and retail (selling to consumers) trade, introducing the role of jobbers as intermediaries.  The practices of wholesale dealers using travellers or drummers to sell goods from samples, often well in advance of production, is highlighted. The concept of price and its determinants, including supply, demand, and monopolies, are also examined. The book concludes this section with an insightful observation about the interconnectedness of global commerce, illustrating how even a local grocer relies on goods from across the world.


### III.  Bank Cheques: Writing and Indorsing

The third section focuses on bank cheques, defining them as orders for money drawn by depositors.  It emphasizes the importance of careful cheque writing to prevent fraud, showcasing examples of poorly written cheques vulnerable to alteration and a well-written example.  The distinction between cheques payable "to order" (requiring endorsement) and "to bearer" (payable to anyone holding it) is explained. The section also includes a detailed guide to cheque indorsements, covering various scenarios, like depositing cheques, transferring to other parties, indorsements for companies, and powers of attorney.  The consequences of carelessness like not writing in amounts carefully, or insufficiently protecting the amount written, are stressed.


### IV.  Bank Cheques: Additional Considerations and Bank Drafts

This section continues the discussion on cheques, addressing situations where identification is needed to cash a cheque.  The section highlights safety measures like including addresses on cheques and using friend's endorsements for identification.  It also covers actions when a cheque is returned marked "No Funds," and the procedure for getting cheques certified to guarantee payment, emphasizing the importance of depositing a certified cheque if unused.  The section then shifts to bank drafts, explaining them as bank-issued cheques drawn on their deposits in other banks. The significance of bank drafts as a reliable method for making payments, especially at long distances, is emphasized, contrasting their use with personal cheques.  Finally, the overall usefulness of banks in modern commerce is underscored.


### V. Promissory Notes: Forms and Characteristics

The section on promissory notes defines them as written promises to pay a specific sum. It explains the terms negotiable (transferable) and non-negotiable notes, emphasizing the importance of the words "bearer" or "order" for negotiability. Different forms of promissory notes are illustrated, highlighting the importance of the date and the day of maturity (including days of grace in some states).  The distinction between regular business paper and accommodation paper (signed as a favor, not for a debt) is made, explaining that even accommodation paper, while lacking value consideration between original parties, can have a good title to an innocent third party holder.  Finally, the process of discounting notes (selling them at a discount) is described.


### VI. The Clearing-House System: Function and Mechanics

This section explains the clearing-house system as a mechanism for efficiently handling the massive volume of cheques deposited daily in banks.  The system's operation is illustrated with a diagram, showing how banks exchange cheques through a central clearing-house to settle net balances, rather than individually collecting each cheque. The enormous scale of clearing-house transactions (in New York, hundreds of millions of dollars daily) is highlighted.  The text traces the route of a cheque between banks in different cities, illustrating the interconnectedness of the banking system and the role of correspondent banks. The section concludes by highlighting the efficiency and low cost of this system for collecting cheques, albeit with some interest loss while cheques are in transit.


### VII. Commercial Drafts: Purpose and Procedure

The section on commercial drafts explains them as formal requests for payment, often used to collect debts. It contrasts them with cheques, emphasizing the difference in their obligation (cheques are legally binding on the bank, drafts are not necessarily binding on the drawee). The process of using a draft to collect a debt is detailed, illustrating the difference between sight drafts (payable immediately) and time drafts (payable after a certain period). The concept of "acceptance" (the drawee's agreement to pay) is explained, and the illustration showcases example draft scenarios with and without acceptance, and with different payment arrangements. The role of banks in handling commercial drafts for collection is emphasized, mentioning the option of discounting drafts before acceptance.


### VIII. Foreign Exchange: Principles and Practices

This section delves into foreign exchange, explaining bills of exchange as commercial drafts drawn on foreign debtors. It illustrates the principles of exchange with hypothetical transactions, showing how drafts can settle international debts and the role of banks in facilitating this process. The influence of supply and demand on exchange rates and the concept of "par of exchange" (currency equivalency) are discussed. The section contrasts the actual transfer of money in gold with using drafts to settle international debts, highlighting the advantage of drafts given the cost of shipping gold, especially when settlements between various parties cancel each other out. The factors influencing exchange rates, such as the balance of trade, and the impact of shipping costs on real exchange rates, are also examined.  Different types of bills of exchange (private and banker's) are illustrated.


### IX.  Letters of Credit:  Facilitating International Travel

The chapter focuses on letters of credit, defining them as instruments enabling travelers to draw on their funds abroad.  Facsimiles of a circular letter of credit are provided and explained, showing how it authorizes payments to the bearer by correspondent banks worldwide. The process of obtaining and using a letter of credit is illustrated, emphasizing its convenience for travelers who can avoid carrying large sums of cash. The section also briefly describes alternative methods of traveler's credit, such as checkbooks issued by the Cheque Bank and express companies.

The legal responsibilities of shareholders and the role of directors in managing the company are also described.


### XI. Protested Paper and Paper Offered for Discount

This section covers the process of protesting unpaid notes and drafts, explaining the legal procedures involved and the notifications sent to makers and indorsers.  It emphasizes the importance of clear instructions to banks regarding protest and the various defenses available to indorsers. The section then shifts to the process of banks assessing paper offered for discount, providing a checklist of factors they consider, such as the borrower's net worth, business type, credit history, and the nature of their assets. The risks associated with various types of paper, and the role of credit departments within banks, are stressed.


### XII. Corporations, Bonds, and Transportation

The section defines public and private corporations and explains the concept of a corporate franchise. It clarifies the distinction between unlimited, limited, and double liability corporations.  The focus then turns to bonds, comparing them with certificates of stock in terms of liability and investment risks.  Different types of bonds (private, government, municipal, mortgage, bottomry) are described. The role of receivers' certificates in financially distressed corporations is explained.  Finally, the chapter briefly touches on the importance of cheap and efficient transportation systems.


### XIII. Transportation Papers and Business Geography (Overview)

The section defines and explains the three key transportation papers: the shipping receipt, the bill of lading, and the waybill. It provides illustrations of each document, explaining their functions and the information they contain.  The negotiability of bills of lading and their importance in transferring ownership of goods during transit are discussed. The remainder of the book, as per the table of contents, contains detailed discussions of the trade features of the British Isles, France, Germany, Spain and Italy, Russia, India, China, Japan, Africa, Australia and Australasia, South America and Canada.

Detailed explanations of various typographic terms and symbols are provided.  Illustrations of printer's proofs and corrected proofs are given to help visualize the process. The crucial importance of carefully written copy is emphasized to minimize the cost and time associated with corrections.  The various types of proofs (galley, revise, page, foundry) received during the publishing process are listed, explaining the significance of timely corrections in each stage.
