# A Summary of Mary Rowlandson's Captivity Narrative

Here's a chronological summary of Mary Rowlandson's narrative, exceeding 10% of the original text length, broken down into detailed paragraphs:

**1. The Lancaster Raid and Initial Captivity:**

The narrative opens on February 10th, 1675, with a brutal attack on Lancaster by a large force of Native Americans. Rowlandson vividly describes the chaotic scene:  "several houses were burning, and the smoke ascending to heaven."  The Indians showed extreme violence, killing indiscriminately;  "five persons taken in one house; the father, and the mother and a sucking child, they knocked on the head."  Rowlandson's own house was soon targeted, subjected to a relentless barrage of gunfire: "the bullets seemed to fly like hail."  Amidst the chaos of gunfire and fire, her brother-in-law was killed, and she and her children were forced to flee their burning home.  Tragically, the escape was fraught with more violence: Rowlandson was wounded, her child was injured, and other family members were killed;  "the bullets flying thick, one went through my side, and the same (as would seem) through the bowels and hand of my dear child in my arms." This opening scene powerfully establishes the brutality and terror of the event, while also foreshadowing the spiritual reflection that will shape the rest of the narrative.

**2. The First Night and Initial Grieving:**

The first night of captivity was a nightmarish experience for Rowlandson.  She and her surviving family members were forced to camp near Lancaster and witness the celebration of their captors:  "Oh the roaring, and singing and dancing, and yelling of those black creatures in the night, which made the place a lively resemblance of hell."  The Indians feasted on the spoils of their raid, contrasting sharply with Rowlandson's own despair and grief. This scene emphasizes the stark contrast between the celebration of destruction by the Natives and the profound loss suffered by Rowlandson.  She reflects on her losses: "All was gone, my husband gone...my children gone, my relations and friends gone, our house and home and all our comforts--within door and without--all was gone (except my life)." This loss, coupled with the brutality of the attack, sets the stage for her upcoming journey.

**3. The Second and Third Removes:  Journey into the Wilderness and Death of a Child:**

The narrative continues to detail the grueling journey into the wilderness. The second removal is marked by exhaustion and the worsening condition of her wounded child: "One of the Indians carried my poor wounded babe upon a horse; it went moaning all along, 'I shall die, I shall die.'"  Rowlandson’s strength failed repeatedly under the physical and emotional burden, highlighting the lack of compassion from her captors:  "But the Lord renewed my strength still, and carried me along, that I might see more of His power."  During the third remove, Rowlandson and her child reach Wenimesset, a Native American town. The Sabbath brings intense spiritual reflection, a contemplation of her past sins,  and an examination of God's justice. Meeting Robert Pepper, a fellow captive, brought a moment of shared suffering and practical advice, aiding in the healing of Rowlandson’s wounds using oaken leaves.  However, despite this small mercy, the suffering continues; Rowlandson's wounded child dies during this time, profoundly impacting her emotional state, yet she acknowledges that God prevented her from ending her life.


**4.  The Fourth and Fifth Removes: Spiritual Strength and Crossing the River:**

The fourth remove brings more hardship, described with vivid imagery: "cold and wet, and snowy, and hungry, and weary, and no refreshing for man but the cold ground to sit on, and our poor Indian cheer."  Rowlandson finds solace in scripture, specifically Jeremiah 31:16:  "Thus saith the Lord, refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears, for thy work shall be rewarded, and they shall come again from the land of the enemy."  The fifth remove involves a perilous river crossing. The sheer number of Indians and their possessions is emphasized: "they were so many, and being somewhat in motion, it was beyond my skill."  The journey across the river becomes a testament to God's protection, and Rowlandson reflects on her changing appetite; “they were sweet and savory to my taste,”  even for food that had once repulsed her. The escape from the English army at the river is seen as evidence of God's plan and timing.

**5.  Subsequent Removes:  Hardships and Hope:**

The following removes detail the ongoing hardships and the cruelty of her captors, further emphasizing her reliance on faith.  She describes the casual cruelty of the Indians and the constant threat of violence, emphasizing the precariousness of her life and the frequent starvation.  Yet amidst these horrors, moments of unexpected kindness emerge, displayed by individual Indians providing small acts of compassion, like sharing food or offering shelter.  This highlights the complexities of the Native American community, with both cruelty and kindness apparent.  She notes the comfort she finds in her Bible and the spiritual lessons she learns, even quoting scripture in times of despair.


**6.  Encounter with King Philip and Continued Spiritual Reflection:**

Rowlandson's encounter with King Philip is described, highlighting the power dynamic and her continuing precarious position.  While Philip offers a semblance of civility, the underlying threat of violence remains.  Rowlandson continues to find strength in her faith, highlighting the importance of her Bible and drawing spiritual comfort from various passages. Her descriptions of Philip and his interactions show a glimpse into the culture and leadership within this Native American community.

**7. The Medfield Raid and Continued Suffering:**

The Medfield raid serves as another brutal example of the war’s cruelty.  Rowlandson witnesses the celebrations and the barbaric treatment of the victims, emphasizing the intensity of the conflict and the suffering inflicted on the colonists.  The vivid description of the scalping and the triumph of the Native Americans over their victims underscores the horror and brutality of the conflict and the fear it instilled in Rowlandson.  It is in the midst of this that she finds the spiritual strength to persevere.


**8.  The Search for Children and Renewed Hope:**

Rowlandson describes her desperate search for her children, emphasizing her emotional turmoil and her deep longing to reunite with them.  The narrative highlights the emotional cost of separation and her continued reliance on prayer and faith for guidance.  The separation is one of the most emotionally-charged sections, reflecting on the painful reality of having her children scattered, and her not knowing if they were alive or dead.

**9.  The Final Removes and Redemption:**

The final removes detail the journey toward redemption, beginning with a shift in the Indians' attitude toward Rowlandson. She experiences both kindness and cruelty from various individuals within the tribe.  The narrative emphasizes the constant threat of violence and the unpredictability of her captors.  The arrival of Mr. John Hoar with news of redemption is a significant turning point.  The events at Wachusett show the complexities of the situation, with moments of unexpected civility and moments of continuing uncertainty before her ultimate release.

**10. Return to Lancaster and Beyond:  Reflection and Healing:**

Rowlandson's return to Lancaster is bittersweet, marked by the destruction of her home and the loss of her community.  The journey home is full of mixed emotions—joy at the prospect of freedom and reunion with her husband, yet sorrow over her losses.  She highlights the kindness and compassion of various people who offered her aid, emphasizing the strong sense of community in the aftermath of the war.  She closes with reflections on her experience, emphasizing her newfound understanding of faith, resilience, and the ephemeral nature of worldly possessions. The passage emphasizes her spiritual growth from her trials.


**11.  Post-Captivity Life and Lasting Impact:**

The final part of the narrative discusses the challenges of re-establishing her life after captivity.  She describes the generosity and support of various friends and community members, highlighting the role of community in recovery and healing.  The closing sentences reflect on the enduring impact of her captivity, both on her spiritual life and her perspective on the world. The lasting impact of the experience is noted, leaving the reader with a sense of the resilience of Rowlandson's faith, even beyond the physical survival of captivity.
