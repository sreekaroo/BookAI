# The Decoration of Houses: A Summary

## I. The Changing Landscape of Decoration

The authors begin by acknowledging a significant shift in architecture and decoration over the past decade, particularly in the United States.  While France maintains its artistic leadership, America's progress is notable, especially considering the limited resources compared to European counterparts.  They highlight two key insights driving this American advancement: the importance of studying the best historical models, and the recognition that the most suitable models for modern life are primarily found in post-1500 Italian and subsequently influenced European buildings.  This isn't a dismissal of earlier styles, but a pragmatic acknowledgment of their functional limitations for contemporary living.  The authors contrast the secure, social lives reflected in later architecture with the precariousness of the medieval period, evident in castles designed for defense rather than comfort.

## II. Medieval and Renaissance Contrasts

The authors meticulously detail the stark differences between medieval and Renaissance architecture, emphasizing how the inherent dangers of the feudal era shaped building designs.  Features like tall keeps, low, narrow doorways, and slit-like windows highlight the era's focus on defense.  They even reference the fact that these features weren't necessarily about aesthetics, but pure necessity:  "the mediæval architect, trained to the uses of necessity, knew that he must design openings that should afford no passage to the besiegers' arrows, no clue to what was going on inside the keep."  They contrast this with the Italian Renaissance, where relative security fostered a different architectural approach, characterized by large-windowed palaces and open civic spaces.  However, the authors argue that the Italian Renaissance palace, while aesthetically impressive, is less directly adaptable to modern private homes than the later French and English adaptations.

## III. The Birth of Modern House Planning

The development of modern house planning, according to Wharton and Codman, is less rooted in small Italian homes and more so in the *mezzanin* or intermediate story of the Italian Renaissance palace.  The creation of high-ceilinged saloons alongside lower-ceilinged rooms led to the *mezzanin*, a feature refined by architects like Bramante and Peruzzi.  This development mirrors sociological trends where changes in lifestyle start among the wealthy and filter down, indicating the *mezzanin* as a crucial precursor to modern planning.  The authors note that the *mezzanin*, often decorated simply, holds valuable lessons for contemporary home design, even if the overall palace plan is less directly applicable.

## IV. The French Influence on Comfort

In contrast to the public-oriented Italian Renaissance, France witnessed a gradual development of private domestic life, which is more relatable to modern sensibilities.  However, they stress that even in France, true modern life began only after the reign of Louis XIV solidified. They highlight that the functional limitations of furniture (designed for portability due to societal unrest) hindered comfort.  They reference Madame de Sévigné's letter highlighting the scarcity of furniture even in Louis XIV's era, showcasing how the focus on movable furnishings influenced both furniture design and the overall sense of home. The authors highlight the Louis XIV arm-chair and the Regency-era *bergère* as pivotal moments in the development of comfortable seating, demonstrating the evolution towards modern domestic comfort.

## V. Originality and Tradition in Design

The authors address a common misconception: the tension between originality and tradition. They argue that true originality in art does not entail a rejection of established principles but rather their innovative application.  They use logic and poetry as parallels, demonstrating that adherence to underlying rules does not stifle creativity but allows for new expressions within established frameworks. This applies directly to architecture and decoration, where fundamental principles of proportion and logic govern successful designs. The authors emphasize that  "decoration is always subservient to proportion," highlighting the crucial role of structural elements in shaping decorative schemes. They use the example of Louis XVI décor to demonstrate how true understanding of the style goes beyond superficial ornamentation.

## VI. Rooms and Their Purposes

Before decorating, the authors stress the importance of understanding a room's intended use, going beyond generic labels like "drawing-room" to consider individual needs and habits. They caution against mistaking cheap novelty for genuine individuality, advocating for comfort as a paramount consideration.  The authors describe the common tendency for rooms to remain dreary and underutilized due to poor planning and arrangement, demonstrating how understanding the user's needs is essential to effective design. The positioning of doors and fireplaces, the accessibility of windows, and the overall privacy of the space are key aspects to evaluate to achieve livable rooms.

## VII. The Treatment of Walls

The authors begin the section on walls with a strong emphasis on proportion and symmetry as essential elements of design, countering the then-prevalent belief that symmetry represented a lack of originality. They cite Isaac Ware's work to underscore the significance of proportion, defining it as "fancy under the restraint and conduct of judgment." They then address the common misapplication of symmetry, demonstrating how it can enhance both visual appeal and the room's functionality. They highlight three primary wall treatments—fresco-painting, panelling, and tapestry— emphasizing that each method should complement the room's architectural lines, with the structural form dominating the decorative elements. The use of the dado is also considered, advocating for its importance in raising the wall's visual center above the furniture line.

## VIII. The Evolving Role of Doors

Wharton and Codman chart the curious evolution of the door in American homes, noting its decline from sliding doors to the eventual absence of doors in some modern houses. They attribute this to the misapplication of originally functional elements, such as the sliding door, which, while intended to save space, often resulted in a loss of privacy and visual coherence. They argue against this trend, advocating for properly proportioned doors hung on hinges, particularly double doors in wider openings, highlighting the importance of privacy in modern house design.  The text also delves into the historical treatment of doors, from the heavily fortified medieval doors to the elaborately painted and carved doors of later periods, showcasing the changing societal values and technological advancements reflected in these designs.

## IX.  Windows: Light, Ventilation, and Aesthetics

The authors continue their focus on openings by discussing the crucial role of windows in a room's design and functionality.  They stress the need to maximize light and ventilation by placing windows as high as possible while adhering to appropriate width restrictions.  They acknowledge the practical and aesthetic merits of windows with smaller panes compared to the large, unbroken sheets of plate glass, drawing parallels to the rhythmic structure of poetry in their emphasis on visual harmony.  They also address the treatment of window curtains and inside shutters, highlighting the historic shift from utilitarian function to decorative excess and arguing for a return to simpler, more functional designs.

## X.  Fireplaces as Focal Points

The chapter on fireplaces emphasizes its traditional role as the central feature of a room, highlighting the importance of connecting the fireplace's lines to the ceiling cornice.  They discuss the evolution of fireplaces from massive Gothic designs to the more compact and efficiently designed fireplaces of later periods. The text cites Blondel's assertion, "Je voudrais n'appliquer à une cheminée que des ornements convenables à l'architecture," underscoring the need for architectural harmony. They discuss the different treatments of the mantelpiece across various periods, comparing the ornate styles of earlier eras with the more restrained designs of the Louis XIV period and beyond. The authors also touch on the functional aspects of fireplace design, including the importance of appropriate materials and the use of iron fire-backs.  Finally, they address the modern trend of cluttering mantelpieces with knick-knacks, suggesting a return to a more minimalist approach that complements the fireplace's architectural design.


## XI. Ceilings and Floors: Structure and Decoration

This section explores the contrasting influences of timber roofs and stone vaults on ceiling designs, noting how flat plaster ceilings were sometimes coffered to mimic timber framing. The authors challenge the modern notion that only structural elements should dictate decoration, citing Roman and Renaissance examples of decorative ceilings that were not directly linked to structural supports.  They trace the evolution of ceilings from open timbered designs in northern Europe to the flat plaster ceilings with stucco ornamentation that became popular later. They discuss the different styles of ceiling decoration across various periods, highlighting the importance of proportion and the integration of ornament with overall architectural form.  The choice of materials (wood, stucco) is also discussed in relation to the room’s overall design. The final portion addresses floor treatment, advocating for the use of more durable and aesthetically pleasing materials like brick, marble, and well-designed parquet flooring over carpets.

## XII.  Entrance, Hall, and Stairs: Public and Private Spaces

The authors distinguish between the entrance and the hall, emphasizing the vestibule’s role as a transition space between the exterior and the private interior. The focus shifts to the hall and staircase, highlighting the historical evolution of these spaces from the medieval hall, which served multiple purposes, to the more formally defined spaces of later periods. They criticize the modern trend of merging the hall and staircase, arguing against the loss of privacy this entails. The text discusses the different materials and decorative styles used for halls and staircases in Italy, France, and England, particularly highlighting the use of marble and wrought iron in France. They offer guidance on appropriately decorating these spaces using simple, strong lines and avoiding the clutter of a typical living area.

## XIII.  Drawing-Rooms, Boudoirs, and Morning Rooms:  Social and Private Life

This section delves into the development of drawing-rooms, boudoirs, and morning rooms, tracing their evolution from medieval spaces to their more refined forms in the 18th century.  They highlight the dual nature of the drawing-room as both a formal entertaining space and a family living area, criticizing the modern tendency to prioritize ostentation over comfort.  They contrast this with the more practical and comfortable approach found in English drawing-rooms.  The discussion extends to boudoirs, highlighting their transformation from intimate spaces to more practical areas, and morning rooms, emphasizing their function as informal gathering spaces where comfort and durability are prioritized.

## XIV.  Gala Rooms:  The Grand Manner

The authors contrast the formal gala rooms—ballrooms, saloons, music rooms, and galleries— with family living spaces. They criticize the modern trend of blurring the lines between these spaces, resulting in large, underutilized rooms that are neither comfortable nor appropriately decorated.  The text analyzes the Italian influence on the design of these rooms, highlighting the Italian mastery of the "grand manner" in architecture. They then describe the different uses and decorative treatments of these spaces in various historical periods, discussing the use of mirrors, marble, and frescoes in creating grand and impressive effects.  The section also addresses the appropriate furnishing of these rooms, suggesting the use of more formal and durable furniture.

## XV. Bedrooms:  From Public to Private

This chapter explores the evolution of bedrooms from multi-purpose spaces in the medieval and Renaissance periods to the more specialized and private rooms of later periods.  They trace the changing role of the bed, noting how it was once the central focus of social gatherings within the bedroom itself.  The authors discuss the changing materials and styles of bed hangings, highlighting the shift from opulent fabrics to lighter, washable materials in the 18th century.  They also advocate for the functional approach of dividing bedrooms into suites of smaller rooms, improving privacy and functionality.

## XVI. Schoolrooms and Nurseries:  Cultivating Taste

The authors emphasize the importance of creating aesthetically pleasing and functional schoolrooms and nurseries, arguing against the common practice of relegating these spaces to the house's least attractive furnishings.  They suggest using the rooms as opportunities to cultivate the children's artistic appreciation by strategically incorporating well-chosen artwork and objects relating to their studies. This section emphasizes the long-term impact of aesthetic education on children's development, encouraging parents to be mindful of the objects and designs present in the children's living spaces.  They emphasize choosing quality over quantity in toys and decorations, encouraging parents to select a few meaningful and aesthetically pleasing items over a large collection of cheaply made trinkets.

## XVII.  Bric-à-Brac: Quality over Quantity

The concluding chapter discusses the pervasive presence of "bric-à-brac," or knick-knacks, in modern homes, contrasting it with the more discerning approach of earlier periods.  The authors advocate for a more selective and thoughtful approach to ornamentation, emphasizing the importance of quality over quantity.  They differentiate between true objects of art and mere decorative items, stressing that an object's value should not be determined solely by its cost.  They encourage a focus on well-designed and expertly executed functional objects, which through the skillful touch of an artist, become inherently decorative.  The text also addresses the issue of reproductions, suggesting a preference for faithful copies over poorly executed original works. The concluding sections stress the importance of simplicity, relevance, and appropriateness in decorative choices, advocating for a return to the more restrained and harmonious styles of the past, in contrast to the superficiality of much modern design.
