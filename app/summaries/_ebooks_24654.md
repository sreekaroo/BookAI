# Chaldea: From Earliest Times to the Rise of Assyria - A Chronological Summary

## The Obliteration of Nineveh and Early Explorations

Nineveh, once a magnificent city, was destroyed around 606 BC after a prolonged siege.  Centuries later, Xenophon, chronicling the "Retreat of the Ten Thousand," unknowingly passed its ruins, describing Larissa (Calah) and Mespila (Nineveh) as deserted cities built of brick and stone, with a nearby pyramid.  This highlights the city's complete destruction and the subsequent loss of its historical memory.  Another hundred years brought Alexander the Great's conquest, during which his troops unknowingly destroyed ancient water control structures, remnants of Chaldean civilization, attributing them to the legendary Nimrod.  Arab rule followed, establishing Baghdad as a significant center, but centuries of Turkish mismanagement reduced the region to desolation, impacting its agriculture and industry due to the neglect of its intricate canal system.

## Layard's Arrival and Early Challenges at Nimrud

Austen Henry Layard arrived in 1845, eager to explore the mounds of Mesopotamia. His initial excitement ("visions of palaces underground, of gigantic monsters, of sculptured figures, and endless inscriptions floated before me") was quickly tempered by difficulties. He encountered the tyrannical Pasha of Mosul, who initially obstructed his work under various pretexts, including the fabricated existence of a Muslim burial ground ("Go, destroy, eat!"). Layard's ingenuity and diplomacy, however, secured the Pasha's temporary acquiescence before his recall. The discovery of a gigantic head, mistaken by the Arabs for Nimrod ("they have found Nimrod himself...we have seen him with our eyes"), further complicated his work.

## The Nature of Mesopotamian Ruins and Layard's Excavation Techniques

The unique character of Mesopotamian ruins stemmed from the lack of readily available stone and timber.  Instead, the abundance of mud led to brick construction ("Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone and slime for mortar"), resulting in massive mounds concealing the remains of palaces and temples.  Layard’s excavation method involved digging trenches, following walls to doorways, and sinking shafts for air and light.  The discovery of Sennacherib's palace at Koyunjik, yielding a treasure trove of artifacts including bronze vessels and fragments of a royal throne ("quantities of studs and small rosettes in mother-of-pearl, ivory and metal...bowls, cups and dishes of bronze"), exemplified the richness of the finds.

## The Nineveh Library and George Smith's Contributions

Layard's discovery of clay tablets at Koyunjik, later identified as the Royal Library of Asshurbanipal, marked a pivotal moment.  George Smith, initially an engraver, dedicated himself to deciphering these fragments.  His painstaking work ("He succeeded in finding and uniting a large quantity of fragments belonging together, and thus restoring pages of writing") yielded invaluable texts on religion, science (including astronomy and astrology), literature, and everyday life, including legal and private documents.  His expeditions to Nineveh, funded by the Daily Telegraph, further enriched this collection before his untimely death.

## The Shumiro-Accadian Civilization and Early Religion

Before the arrival of Semitic peoples, the Shumiro-Accadians, a Turanian group, inhabited Chaldea. They possessed advanced technology, including writing and metallurgy, but their religious beliefs were primitive, focusing on numerous spirits, both benevolent and malevolent. François Lenormant's work highlights their cosmology ("an inverted round boat or bowl"), their fear of the seven Maskim ("Seven they are in the depths of Ocean...they are seven, they are seven, seven they are!"), and their reliance on magic and incantations. The incantations often involved dialogues with the gods Êa and Meridug, seeking protection and remedies.

## The Arrival of the Semites and the Development of Chaldean Religion

The arrival of Semitic peoples marked a shift in Chaldean culture and religion.  The legend of Oannes, recounted by Berosus, describes a divine being who brought civilization and knowledge to the land.  Debate exists whether these newcomers were primarily Cushites or Semites. The Semites gradually integrated with the Shumiro-Accadians, resulting in a blended culture. The religion evolved, incorporating elements of both cultures, with the focus shifting towards the worship of heavenly bodies (Sabeism) and a more defined pantheon of gods.  The priesthood gained significant power, influenced by astrology and divination.

## Early Chaldean Kings and the Rise of Babylon

The early Chaldean political landscape was fragmented into city-states ruled by priest-kings (_patesis_). Sargon I. of Agadê, a prominent Semitic figure, unified a significant portion of the region. His story, recounted in his own inscriptions, resembles a common hero myth about a mysterious birth and rise to power.  His son, Naram-Sin, is documented on a cylinder unearthed by Nabonidus, providing valuable chronological information, dating Sargon I to approximately 3800 BC, which significantly revises earlier estimations.  Other important figures include Gudêa, whose statues display distinctly Turanian features and Ur-Nammu and his son Shulgi, who unified Shumir and Accad under their rule.  The Elamite invasion interrupted this period of relative stability.

## Babylonian Religion: A Synthesis of Beliefs

The Babylonian religion, developed under the later Semitic rulers, represented a synthesis of existing beliefs, although retaining older practices alongside its newly formed structure.  The pantheon included Anu, Êa, and Bel as supreme deities, while Sin, Shamash, and Ramân formed a triad representing celestial and atmospheric forces. The five planets were linked to specific deities.  The dual nature of divine beings, reflecting male and female principles, was a prominent characteristic, exemplified by Bel and Belit, and Ishtar. The worship of the heavenly bodies (Sabeism) was prevalent but mixed with an older belief in spirits, leading to the development of astrology and divination.

## Chaldean Legends and the Book of Genesis: Shared Origins

The Chaldean creation myths, uncovered by George Smith's work, exhibit remarkable similarities to the Book of Genesis.  Both narrate the creation of the world from chaos, the establishment of celestial bodies, and the creation of man.  The story of the flood in the Epic of Gilgamesh strongly parallels the Biblical account. While both share common origins, the Hebrew version emphasizes monotheism, while the Chaldean accounts retain polytheistic elements and rich mythical imagery.  The Sacred Tree and the legend of Eden are shared symbols, showing continuity in belief systems across cultures. 

## The Epic of Gilgamesh: Myth and History Intertwined

The Epic of Gilgamesh, a twelve-tablet poem, recounts the adventures of the hero-king Izdubar, drawing from both historical events and mythical narratives.  The poem details the decline and subjugation of Erech under Elamite rule, the hero's friendship with Êabâni, his battles and triumphs, his quest for immortality, and the account of the Great Flood.  The poem's narrative structure and imagery are linked to the Chaldean calendar and are interpreted as a solar myth, representing the sun's yearly cycle.  The "Descent of Ishtar" is an important sub-narrative depicting the queen of love and war's journey to the underworld to rescue her lover Tammuz (Dumuzi), a symbolic representation of the seasons and the cyclical nature of life and death.


## The Legacy of Chaldea

The exploration of the Chaldean ruins provided invaluable insights into the origins of civilization and religious thought.  The study of cuneiform tablets revealed a complex system of beliefs and practices, offering glimpses into everyday life and governmental structures. The Chaldean legacy is evident in the fields of astronomy, mathematics, and even in certain aspects of later religions. The similarities between Chaldean legends and the Book of Genesis highlighted shared cultural roots.  The discoveries underscored the significance of the region as a cradle of civilization and the remarkable continuity of some religious beliefs and practices. Despite the destruction and the long periods of neglect and misrule that followed, the remains of Chaldean civilization, painstakingly unearthed, provide a window into a profound and complex past.
