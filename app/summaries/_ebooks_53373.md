# A Manual of Historic Ornament: A Summary

## Oceanic Ornamentation (Prehistoric - 1899)

The book begins by exploring the unique ornamental art of Oceania.  Glazier highlights the independent development of these styles, untouched by external influences. The art is characterized by its symbolism, often derived from abstract human forms, and arranged with a surprising geometric precision for a primitive culture.  He divides Polynesian and Melanesian ornament into distinct provinces, noting New Zealand's advanced artistry compared to Australia's simpler incised linear designs.  Specific examples are cited, including the female figure adaptations of the Hervey and Austral Islands and New Zealand's pierced carving with spiral forms.  The author emphasizes the linear nature of much of the ornament, using "parallel and zig-zag lines" as a descriptive term, and  contrasts this with the inlaid mother of pearl of the Solomon Islands.  Glazier's illustrations are key to understanding the distinct styles across the different island groups.

## Ancient Egyptian Art (4400 BC - 340 BC)

The Egyptian civilization, spanning millennia and numerous dynasties, is examined through its artistic achievements.  Glazier divides Egyptian history into three periods: the Ancient, Middle, and New Empires. He notes the construction of the Great Pyramids during the Fourth Dynasty, citing specific dimensions and the reigns of their builders (Kheops, Kephren, and Mykerinos). The Sphinx, described as "the oldest sculpture known," is mentioned as predating even the early realistic portraiture of the 3rd and 4th dynasties. The author highlights the unique "Cavo Relievo" technique, where figures were sunk and then carved from within, with the raised background often painted in vibrant colours ("red, blue, green, and yellow").  Egyptian friezes, showing scenes of daily life and hieroglyphs, are analyzed for their simple yet refined decorative qualities.  The symbolic use of the lotus flower, representing "fertility and a new life," is emphasized, as is the innovation of the Hathor Capital during the 18th Dynasty.

## Assyrian and Babylonian Art (1100 BC - 539 BC)

The history of Assyria and Babylonia, characterized by constant warfare, is contextualized within the development of their distinct artistic styles.  Built primarily from brick due to the scarcity of stone, Assyrian cities featured alabaster slabs carved with low reliefs depicting kings and warriors ("scenes representing the King and his warriors engaged in hunting or fighting").  Glazier contrasts Assyrian art with Egyptian, noting the absence of scenes depicting agricultural pursuits. He discusses the use of enamelled bricks, particularly those of Chaldea, with their "turquoise blue, yellow, white and black" enamels, citing the impressive "Frieze of Archers from the Palace of Susa" as an example.   The author identifies key Assyrian ornamental motifs, such as the Lotus and Bud, Rosette, and Horn or Tree of Life, noting the Egyptian influence on the Lotus. The Anthemion, with its "alternate bud and fir-cone," is detailed for its beautiful line and mass.

## The Golden Age of Greek Art (800 BC - 140 BC)

The discussion moves to the pinnacle of Classical architecture, focusing on the three Greek orders: Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian.  Glazier describes the defining features of each order—the column, capital, and entablature—with detailed descriptions of proportions and fluting.  The Parthenon, built by Ictinus and Callicrates (438 BC), is highlighted as the culmination of Doric architecture, with its sculptured metopes (depicting "the battle between the Centaurs and Lapithæ") and the renowned Panathenaic frieze, showcasing the "rhythm of movement and unity of composition" of its relief sculptures.  The author mentions the lost Chryselephantine statue of Athena by Phidias.  The Erechtheum and Temple of Nike Apteros are examined as significant examples of Ionic architecture, with its Caryatides and delicate reliefs.  The relative heights of entablatures in different Grecian buildings are tabulated for analysis. The text also covers significant Doric temples in the Greek colonies of Sicily.

## Roman Architecture and Ornament (753 BC - 337 AD)

Roman architecture is presented as a synthesis of Greek and Etruscan styles, marked by the innovative use of the arch and the superposition of orders. Glazier notes the construction of triumphal arches (Septimius Severus, Titus, Constantine) and the Theatre of Marcellus, with its superimposed Doric and Ionic orders.  The Pantheon, with its coffered ceiling and impressive Corinthian portico, is highlighted. The Roman orders (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Tuscan, and Composite) are detailed, including their proportions. Roman houses ("Domus" and "Insular") and their layouts (Atrium, Peristylium, Tablinum) are described.  Roman ornament is characterized by its exuberance and vigorous carving, contrasting with the refinement of Greek art.  The continuous scroll, clothed with acanthus foliage and terminating in rosettes, is identified as a key element, along with the use of festoons, candelabra, and mythical creatures. The Column of Trajan and the Basilica of Trajan are mentioned as examples of Roman engineering and artistic skill.

## Pompeian Art (79 AD)

The eruption of Vesuvius and the subsequent discovery of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabia provide a snapshot of Roman life in the 1st century AD. Glazier details the incredible wealth of artifacts unearthed, including murals, mosaics, and bronze sculptures. The layout of typical Roman houses is shown, emphasizing the use of mosaics and wall paintings with their characteristic dado, pilasters, panels, and friezes.  The Pompeian painted ornament is described as more delicate than Roman relief work, while retaining the spiral forms and acanthus foliage.  The use of stucco enrichments, such as the egg-and-dart and water-leaf patterns, is noted as a frequent accompaniment to the painted decorations.

## Byzantine Art (330 AD - 1453 AD)

The shift of the Roman capital to Byzantium marks the beginning of the Byzantine style.  Glazier emphasizes the synthesis of Greek, Roman, Persian, and Syrian artistic traditions, shaped by the new Christian religion.  The Hagia Sophia, built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidorus of Miletus under Justinian (538 AD), is cited as the apex of Byzantine architecture, showcasing its innovative dome, semi-domes, and the extensive use of mosaics.  The use of Christian symbols (circle, cross, vine, dove, peacock) in conjunction with acanthus is highlighted.  The churches of Ravenna are mentioned for their mosaics and capitals. The symbolism of the circle and cross as constructive features in Byzantine planning is detailed.

## Scandinavian and Celtic Art (Early Viking period - 15th century)

Scandinavian art, largely represented by bronze and silver work, is noted for its intricate interlacing animal forms, primarily dragons. The author mentions the Viking ship of Sandifiord and the Sigurd Overlap, which illustrate the story of the dragon Fafni. The text details the legend of Fafni and its impact on Scandinavian ornament.  Glazier moves to Celtic ornamentation, focusing on its distinctive spiral and interlacing forms, seen in carved stonework, bronze, enamel, and illuminated manuscripts. The author notes the influence of Byzantine and Lombardic styles and traces the serpent or dragon motif to Scandinavian origins.  The Lismore crosier is cited as a prime example of Celtic dracontine treatment. The transition from bronze work to Christian period artistry is highlighted by the Ardagh chalice and Tara Brooch.

## The Italian Renaissance (1300 AD - 1600 AD)

The Italian Renaissance is divided into three periods (Trecento, Quattrocento, Cinquecento). Glazier traces the blending of classical, Lombardic, and Gothic influences in the Tre-cento.  The Quattrocento is associated with the works of Ghiberti (bronze gates of the Florentine Baptistery), Jacopo della Quercia (tomb of Ilaria del Carretto), Luca della Robbia (enameled terracotta), Donatello (bas-reliefs and sculpture), and many medallists. The Cinquecento is discussed as the culmination of the Renaissance with work from Michelangelo (Sistine Chapel ceiling, Medici tombs), Raphael (Vatican Stanze, Loggia), and numerous other artists and craftsmen.  The impact of rediscovered Roman arabesques on the decorative arts is highlighted.  The development of Renascence styles in Florence, Rome and Venice is discussed as a period of great patronage of the arts.

## French and English Renaissance (1453 AD - 1804 AD)

The French Renaissance is described as initially Italianate, but later evolving into a distinct style, incorporating Gothic traditions.  Glazier divides the period into several phases (Early transitional; François I, Henri II, Henri IV, Louis XIII, Louis XIV, Louis XV, Louis XVI, and Empire). Key figures are mentioned, including Jean Goujon, Pierre Lescot, and the influence of Italian artists like Rosso and Primaticcio on Fontainebleau. The English Renaissance, influenced by Flemish, German, and Italian styles alongside existing Gothic traditions, is noted.  Important architects and stucco workers (Inigo Jones, Wren, Robert Adam) and the prevalence of strapwork are discussed.  The development of English stucco work, from geometric panelling to acanthus foliage and festoons, is traced.

## Islamic and East Asian Ornamentation (7th century - 1899)

The rise of the Arab Empire and its impact on art is examined, highlighting the patronage of the Khalifs and the influence of Islamic religious precepts.  Mahometan art is divided into Arabian, Moresque, Persian, Indian, and Sicilian styles, each having common characteristics while retaining distinct regional qualities.  Persian ornamentation is described as having a strong connection to Assyrian and Babylonian traditions, further developing under the Sassanides and reaching its peak under Shah Abbas. Glazier notes the combination of floral forms with Arabic inscriptions in lustred wall tiles.  Indian ornamentation blends traditional motifs with the incorporation of animal and human figures.  Chinese and Japanese art is contrasted, highlighting the enduring traditional elements of Chinese art (dragon, peony, chrysanthemum) versus the more naturalistic approach of Japanese art (birds, flowers, and landscapes).  The use of various materials such as bronze, wood, ivory, and lac in Japanese art is pointed out.  The text concludes with detailed discussions of the decorative applications of various materials (ivory, mosaics, glass, stained glass, gold and silver, bronzes, wrought iron, furniture, and textiles) across different periods and cultures.  The concept of continuity and adaptation in design is repeatedly used, emphasizing recurring motifs and their evolution across time and geography.
