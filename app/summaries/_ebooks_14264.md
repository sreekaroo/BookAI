# The Practice and Science of Drawing: A Summary

## I.  The Nature of Art and its Definition

Harold Speed begins by acknowledging the intuitive nature of artistic creation, suggesting that excessive intellectual analysis might stifle an artist's natural inspiration. He emphasizes that while intuition is crucial, strong talent requires a well-developed executive faculty.  He then explores various definitions of art, finding shortcomings in prevalent interpretations. He proposes a working definition:  "the Rhythmic expression of Feeling," where rhythm signifies the ordering of artistic materials to resonate with an innate sense of harmony. This definition encompasses all art forms, highlighting the need for ordered expression beyond mere representation. Speed argues that art conveys emotional consciousness, using examples such as singing, storytelling, and building to illustrate how mere expression differs from artistic creation which must be ordered and rhythmic to truly move others.   He concludes this section by emphasizing that art training focuses on perfecting the means of expression, not on dictating feeling itself.

## II. The Essence of Drawing: Beyond Mere Accuracy

Speed defines drawing as "the expression of form upon a plane surface," stressing that it goes beyond mere mechanical accuracy. He argues that good drawing requires emotional engagement with the subject, leading to a selective emphasis on significant forms and the suppression of non-essentials.  He contrasts this artistic accuracy with scientific accuracy, where observation is unemotional.  He uses examples of powerful and light drawings, noting Michael Angelo's expression of mass and Botticelli's lightness. He cites Leonardo da Vinci's emphasis on "making a simple flat surface appear like a relievo," highlighting the then-dominant focus on tactile, rather than purely visual, perception of form. He ends by reiterating that although emotional expression should ultimately guide drawing, academic training must still instill a "searching accuracy".

## III. The Role of Vision and the Limitations of Touch

Speed delves into the complexities of vision, explaining how light and its reflection create visual images on the retina. He highlights that these retinal images are two-dimensional, raising the question of how we perceive depth and solidity. He attributes the understanding of the third dimension to the integration of sight with the sense of touch, gained through early tactile exploration of the world.  He explains how this prior tactile experience leads to a mental conception of form that often overrides purely visual perception in early drawings by children, illustrated with two diagrams—one demonstrating typical children’s drawings based on felt shape versus one based on visual impressions. This section concludes with the idea that most adults do not fully utilize vision for its own sake, rather relying on touch associations, a point he attributes to the visual blindness of many.

## IV. Line Drawing: An Exploration of Outlines and Form

Speed focuses on line drawing, identifying its origin in the sense of touch rather than purely visual perception.  He traces the historical development of drawing from simple outlines to the inclusion of shading, highlighting Leonardo da Vinci's crucial contribution of understanding light and shade. He observes that even with the introduction of shading, the underlying structure of outline persisted in the work of the Renaissance masters. He discusses the potential limitations of excessive detail obscuring design, citing the revival of line drawing as a response. Speed cites the Parthenon as a perfect example of the union of primitive strength and sophisticated refinement, stating that the finest art blends primitive qualities with cultured additions without diminishing its expression.  He concludes by emphasizing the importance of pure line drawing for a strong artistic foundation.

## V. Mass Drawing: An Impressionist Perspective

Speed introduces mass drawing as an alternative to line drawing, directly related to visual appearances as perceived on the retina. He contrasts Western art's reliance on outline with the Eastern emphasis on mass, citing Chinese and Japanese art as examples. He positions Velazquez as the first artist to create a painting entirely from the visual standpoint, citing "Las Meninas" as evidence, emphasizing the loss of traditional design. He discusses the Impressionist movement's focus on visual impressions and their impact on draughtsmanship.  He highlights that despite the beauty found in impressionism, it's a limitation to consider only visual perception, as the mind plays a crucial role in interpreting visual information, emphasizing the importance of selection and significance.

## VI. Academic vs. Conventional Art: The Search for Vitality

Speed addresses the frequent criticism of academic art as lifeless and formulaic. He explains that while academic training is vital for developing technical skill, this should only be the foundation for artistic expression, not the ultimate goal.  He uses the metaphor of a perfectly assembled engine that won't work due to a lack of “dither”—a vitalizing play between the parts—to illustrate the deadness of purely mechanical accuracy.  He critiques the pursuit of originality for originality's sake and advocates for sincerity instead. He argues against rigid adherence to conventions, highlighting that all art forms employ conventions which are either more natural or abstract depending on context and medium.  He uses examples like Flaubert's "a form deadens" and the lifeless nature of Madame Tussaud's Waxworks to illustrate how a lack of vitality makes art lifeless regardless of style.

## VII.  The Two Paths of Drawing: Line and Mass

Speed proposes a dual approach to learning drawing, involving simultaneous study of line and mass drawing.  He argues that a comprehensive understanding of form requires studying both separately. He encourages students to begin with extreme versions of each approach:  pure outline for line drawing and simple tone masses for mass drawing.  He emphasizes that this dual approach prevents confusion and ensures a more complete grasp of form.  He points out the common problem of students using a paintbrush like chalk, indicating a failure to master mass drawing concepts.  He stresses the importance of mastering both methods, eventually merging the knowledge gained from both into a cohesive understanding of form expression.


## VIII.  Practical Line Drawing: Techniques and Principles

Speed provides practical guidance on line drawing, emphasizing the need to perceive objects as flat on a plane surface before rendering them.  He suggests using a cardboard frame with a grid to assist in this process and demonstrates how to accurately place salient points using vertical and horizontal lines and measurement techniques, employing a plumb line and knitting needle to aid in accurate comparisons. He describes "blocking in" the drawing, akin to a surveyor's method, using straight lines as a scaffolding to capture the shape of curves.  He details drawing techniques, emphasizing the importance of constructing forms by observing the overlapping of contours.  He also explains the principles of light and shade, illustrating how high lights and shadows behave on simple and complex forms.  He concludes by offering a logical method of line shading, advising against haphazard lines, and encouraging students to develop a sensitive appreciation for line by studying the works of master draughtsmen.


## IX. Practical Mass Drawing:  Brushwork and Tone

Speed shifts to mass drawing, emphasizing its relevance to painting with a brush. He suggests a simple exercise using a cast, emphasizing the initial blocking out of tone masses in charcoal before proceeding to paint.  He details a technique of scumbling a middle tone over the canvas, then painting lights and darks into this base.  He explains how the thickness of the paint affects the resulting tone, lighter with thicker applications and darker with thinner ones.  He further discusses different types of brushstrokes, outlining the properties of different brushes (round, flat, filbert) and the effects they can achieve.  He also explains retouching techniques, stressing the importance of working swiftly and decisively, and avoiding a timid approach.  He concludes by discussing the relationship between brushstrokes and the expression of form, emphasizing the analogy between line directions and brushstroke directions in conveying softness, fullness, hardness, and atmosphere.

## X. Rhythm in Art: Unity and Variety in Line and Mass

Speed introduces the concept of rhythm in art, describing it as the power of lines, tones, and colors to affect us emotionally, similar to music. He discusses the interplay of unity and variety in artistic composition, drawing parallels to the balance between harmony and contrast in color.  He argues that while unity is essential for coherence, variety is crucial for injecting life and interest into the artwork.  He examines the contrasting approaches of Egyptian art (emphasizing unity and suppressing variety) and Greek art (balancing unity with life-giving variety). He analyzes the role of straight lines (associated with sublimity and repose) and curved lines (associated with energy and grace) in achieving this balance. He uses examples from Blake's illustrations of the Book of Job to illustrate the concept of parallelism, a technique that emphasizes and unifies specific lines, creating a sustained emotional effect. He further explores the use of horizontal and vertical lines, diagonals, and curved lines to create unity and dynamism in composition, supported by analyses of works by Veronese and Botticelli.


## XI.  Balance and Proportion:  Harmonious Relationships in Art

Speed explores the concept of balance in art, drawing parallels to the balance of opposing forces in nature and society.  He discusses the balance between straight lines and curves, highlighting how rich curves require a counterbalancing influence of stronger straight lines to achieve repose, unless energy and movement are the artistic goal.  He also addresses the balance between flat and gradated tones, and light and dark tones, illustrating how extremes must be balanced to maintain visual harmony.  He also touches on the balance between warm and cold colors, explaining how vibrant warm colors need cool colors for counterpoint.  The concept of balancing interest and mass is explained, with the use of a small figure to balance a large mass, illustrating the power of interest over scale.  Finally, he reiterates the crucial balance between variety and unity, concluding that good compositions harmonize these seemingly conflicting elements.


## XII.  Portrait Drawing: Capturing Character and Likeness

Speed turns to portrait drawing, emphasizing the capture of individual character over mere likeness. He highlights the remarkable uniqueness of each individual face, and the artist’s role in capturing the unique personality expressed in the sitter’s form. He emphasizes the importance of identifying the individual’s characteristics that set them apart from a common type, suggesting that these features should be addressed first before focusing on commonalities.  He discusses several approaches to portraiture: the “striking presentment of the live person,” emphasizing vitality, which is contrasted with a more formal approach focusing on calmly expressing the forms' significance and leaving interpretation to the viewer. He points out that there may be conflict between these two approaches in portrait drawing, illustrating each with examples from well-known artists.   He concludes by addressing expression and the treatment of clothing in portraiture, suggesting that focusing on inherent qualities of form and fabric ensures timelessness.

## XIII.  Visual Memory and Artistic Development

Speed underscores the vital role of visual memory in art.  He discusses how memories of pictures influence our perception of nature, acknowledging that these memories can color our views. He contrasts the direct-from-nature approaches of movements like Pre-Raphaelitism and Impressionism with the use of memory as a means of selecting and refining visual information.  He argues that the ability to analyze visual impressions in terms of line and tone is essential for artistic memory.  He recommends regular memory-drawing exercises to develop this ability. Speed emphasizes that even when working from life, the artist primarily works from memory, adhering to a preconceived scheme and selecting from nature only what supports that initial vision. He concludes this section by emphasizing the unity of emotional and technical aspects of art, which should be integrated.


## XIV.  Procedure and Materials:  Practical Advice for the Artist

Speed offers practical advice on artistic procedure, warning against a careless or haphazard approach. He urges students to develop a clear mental image of their work before starting, stressing the importance of carefully executed initial strokes and avoiding hasty corrections.  He provides insights into the choice of materials, highlighting how each medium's unique properties influence the artist's selection of expressive qualities in nature. He discusses various drawing mediums (lead pencil, silver and gold point, charcoal, red chalk, Conté crayon, lithographic chalk, pen and ink, and etching), highlighting their specific characteristics and applications. He emphasizes the importance of selecting a medium that aligns with the artist's individual style.  He discusses various aspects of paper selection and concludes by stressing that mastery of each medium entails understanding its limitations and utilizing its inherent properties.
