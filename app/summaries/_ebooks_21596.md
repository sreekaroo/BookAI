### **Architects' Incomes and the Death of George F. Durand**

The text begins by addressing a misleading newspaper article that grossly exaggerates architects' incomes, claiming that ten New York architects earn over $100,000 annually.  The author counters this with anecdotes, suggesting that such high earners are exceptionally rare, and uses the example of renowned architect R.M. Hunt, whose success, according to a contractor, was partly due to his wealthy wife. This disparity highlights the vast gap between reality and the inflated image presented in the media, warning against the harm such misinformation causes to both the public perception of the profession and the architects themselves. The author emphasizes the struggles faced by most architects, including the need for supplementary income sources like teaching, writing, or even designing wallpapers. The passage concludes by noting the high dropout rate from the profession, as many aspiring architects realize their earning expectations are unrealistic.  The death of George F. Durand, a prominent Canadian architect, is then announced, highlighting his accomplishments in London, Ontario, and Albany, NY, at the young age of 39.


### **Concrete Arches and Architectural Responsibility**

A description of experiments conducted on concrete arches during the construction of a railway station in Erfurt follows.  These experiments showed that segmental concrete arches, even with homogeneous material, are significantly stronger than flat ones, because the arched form converts vertical pressure into lateral thrust. This contradicts the prevailing theory that concrete arches act as lintels without thrust. The author emphasizes the importance of further research to determine the thrust of various arch forms to improve the safety and efficiency of concrete construction, a technique likely to become widely adopted.  The text also details a test on the effects of freezing on concrete, which unexpectedly demonstrated its resilience.


### **Architects' Liability for Cost Overruns**

The text shifts to a discussion of an architect's legal responsibility when construction costs exceed the initial estimates. The author references Frémy-Ligneville, a legal expert, who states that architects are only liable for damages if they intentionally mislead their clients through fraudulent estimates.  Otherwise, the estimate is considered an opinion, not a guarantee. The text suggests that clients can protect themselves through obtaining multiple independent estimates, detailed contracts with builders, and careful examination of plans and specifications before the construction starts.  Furthermore,  clients are encouraged to adjust the plans and specifications during the construction process if cost overruns become apparent.


### **A Paris Case and Profit-Sharing**

The author strengthens their previous point using a 1855 Paris court case, where a client was denied compensation against the architect for cost overruns due to the architect’s timely notifications and the client’s subsequent acquiescence. The author also describes the Peto Brothers' innovative profit-sharing scheme in England, where a quarter of the net profit from a large public building project would be distributed among the workers according to their wages, provided they adhere to certain conditions of good behavior and adherence to the work schedule. The scheme is presented as an interesting social experiment with possible implications for future labor relations.


### **The Apartment House vs. the Independent Dwelling**

The article presents a detailed cost comparison between apartment living ("flats") and individual detached houses ("towers") in a Back Bay, Boston, context. Architect J. P. Putnam argues that apartment living offers both luxury and economy, contrasting the older, inefficient model of individual house building.  Using detailed plans and cost estimations, Putnam demonstrates how a comparable living space in an apartment building would cost significantly less than a similar-sized detached house.  He breaks down costs per square foot of "available" living space, excluding shared amenities, highlighting the inefficiencies of the “tower” model due to wasted space in staircases, heating systems, and other individual necessities.


### **Economic and Social Advantages of Apartment Living**

Putnam continues his argument, highlighting further advantages of apartment living beyond cost savings.  He emphasizes the relief from household management burdens, the enhanced security offered by shared security systems and fire safety measures, and the potential for improved architectural design in multi-family dwellings that allow for more creative and aesthetically pleasing layouts.  He refutes potential arguments against apartment living, stating that soundproofing and privacy can be achieved through proper construction, and that the shared social spaces offered by apartment living create a more enjoyable living experience.


### **Architecture in Brooklyn and the Formation of a Department of Architecture**

The article shifts its focus to the burgeoning architectural scene in Brooklyn and the establishment of a Department of Architecture at the Brooklyn Institute.  Louis De Coppet Berg, in his address, stresses the importance of a professional organization that facilitates communication and collaboration among local architects, emphasizing the need to address both the artistic and practical aspects of the profession.  He contrasts the tendency for architects to dwell on historical styles with the practical realities of modern construction, including plumbing, heating, ventilation, and electrical systems.


### **The Study of Architecture: A Balancing Act Between History and Practice**

Professor Russell Sturgis's address on "The Study of Architecture"  follows.  Sturgis highlights the inherent separation between the practical application of architecture and the historical study of the art, emphasizing the need to bridge this gap. He notes the limitations of solely studying historical styles to create modern architecture, using the Gothic Revival as an example of a movement that failed to generate substantial artistic innovation. He advocates for a hands-on approach, emphasizing the importance of experience and the creation of new forms and designs over a strict adherence to historical precedents.


### **The Arts of Expression vs. Decoration in Architecture**

Sturgis distinguishes between "arts of expression," which focus on conveying meaning or ideas, and "arts of decoration," which prioritize adornment and aesthetic appeal. He argues that architecture is primarily an industrial endeavor that must fulfill functional requirements before considering aesthetic considerations. While acknowledging the importance of decoration, he points out the current shortcomings in architectural sculpture and design,  due largely to a lack of skilled artisans and the difficulty of balancing practical demands with aesthetic refinement.


### **The Future of Architecture and the Need for Support**

Sturgis concludes his speech with the suggestion that communities and patrons need to support artists who can focus on creative design, separating this work from the practical aspects of construction management.  He points out the underappreciated importance of architectural sculpture and details, suggesting that a focus on both historical study and contemporary practice is essential.  He calls for a more open and receptive attitude towards contemporary art, while criticizing the high import duties on artwork and the lack of fair compensation for artists. The article concludes with an account of the Barye Exhibition, highlighting Barye's genius and the significant collection of his works on display, alongside paintings by his contemporaries like Millet, Corot, and Troyon.  The exhibition is presented as a testament to the vitality and enduring appeal of art.
