# Roman Sepulchral Inscriptions: A Summary

This summary organizes John Kenrick's "Roman Sepulchral Inscriptions" into chronological sections, detailing key arguments and providing illustrative examples.

## 1. The Historical Significance of Sepulchral Monuments

Kenrick begins by establishing the importance of sepulchral monuments as primary historical sources, particularly in cultures lacking widespread literacy. While Egyptian hieroglyphs and Greek epitaphs often offer limited biographical detail, Roman inscriptions, especially those from the Scipio family, showcase a unique blend of formality and strong individuality.  He cites an example from the tomb of Publius Scipio, a series of Saturnian verses that highlight the brevity of life and the deceased's potential for surpassing the achievements of his ancestors:  "Quei apicem, insigne Dialis Flaminis, gesistei / Mors perfecit tua ut tibi essent omnia brevia, / Honos, fama virtusque, gloria atque ingenium."

## 2. Geographic Distribution of Roman Inscriptions

Kenrick then explores the geographic distribution of Roman sepulchral inscriptions, noting their abundance in Rome and Northern Italy, as well as their presence in Gaul, Spain, and North Africa. He contrasts this with the relatively fewer inscriptions found in Britain, attributing this scarcity to Britain's remote location, limited Roman integration, and early abandonment by Roman forces. The language of the inscriptions serves as an indicator of Roman influence in a given region.

## 3. Roman Burial Practices and the Ustrinum

The author discusses the common Roman practice of extramural burial—placing tombs outside city limits.  The exception to this is cited as the practice of Sparta, under Lycurgus's rule, where burial was within the city to familiarize citizens with death.  Kenrick highlights the seemingly contradictory proximity of the _ustrinum_ (cremation site) to Roman settlements, contrasting this with Augustus's later decree to maintain a fifteen-stadia distance. The location of the _ustrinum_ at York remains uncertain, but examples at Pompeii and Aldborough are mentioned as being relatively close to city gates. He notes that in Litlington, however, the ustrinum was a separate, walled-off area.

## 4. Messages to Travelers and Warnings to Violators

Kenrick analyzes common inscriptions addressing passersby.  The frequent use of phrases like "SISTE VIATOR" and "VIATORES SALVETE ET VALETE" illustrates the public nature of Roman burial sites.  He notes that these addresses often include moral reflections or, less frequently, Epicurean sentiments like that found on Prima Pompeia's tomb: "FORTUNA SPONDET MULTA MULTIS, PRÆSTAT NEMINI, VIVE IN DIES ET HORAS, NAM PROPRIUM EST NIHIL." The author also discusses the common threat of vandalism and the resulting warnings inscribed on tombs, such as "SCRIPTOR PARCE HOC OPUS."

## 5. Legal Aspects of Burial Rights and Inheritance

A significant portion focuses on the legal aspects of burial, reflecting the Romans' concern for preventing the alienation or misuse of family burial plots.  Inscriptions often specify the dimensions of the burial plot ("HIC LOCUS PATET IN FRONTEM PEDES XX.; IN AGRUM PEDES XXV.") and delineate who is permitted to be interred within ("SIBI SUISQUE FECIT").  The text details how families sought to protect their burial places from greedy heirs through phrases like "HOC MONUMENTUM HÆREDEM NON SEQUITUR" and detailed clauses forbidding sale, donation, or pledging of the land. The fear of legal challenges is reflected in phrases like "HUIC MONUMENTO DOLUS MALUS ABESTO."

## 6.  Appendages to Sepulchers and Commemorative Rites

Kenrick moves on to describe the structures and rituals associated with Roman tombs.  Testators often provided for annual commemorations, specifying legacies ("125 denarii") for feasts and offerings at the tomb on the deceased's birthday. These celebrations included libations, scattering of flowers ("rosalia"), and sometimes involved the local community.  He notes the role of freedmen as caretakers ("_ædituus_") and the provision for maintaining lamps ("ardente lucernam") in the tombs.  The details given reveal a practical approach to ensuring ongoing respect for the deceased.

## 7. Causes of Death and Medical Complaints

The text observes that causes of death are infrequently specified in inscriptions.  Examples are provided of unusual deaths (a child falling into a well, slaves crushed in a crowd) and the rare mention of death by magic incantation. Kenrick discusses complaints about the ineffectiveness of medicine ("TURBA MEDICORUM SE PERIISSE") and the shortcomings of surgeons ("MEDICI MALE MEMBRA SECARUNT").

## 8. Linguistic Insights from Sepulchral Inscriptions

The author emphasizes the value of sepulchral inscriptions for linguistic study, pointing out that they provide a record of the evolution of the Latin language over centuries, more accurately reflecting common speech than formal documents. He provides examples of grammatical variations and archaisms found in inscriptions, such as the use of "dua" for "duo", "evento" for "eventui", and the addition of an "i" before words starting with "s" and a consonant ("iscambio").  The movement of Latin towards Italian is demonstrated with examples like "meses" for "menses" and "senu" for "sinu".

## 9. Occupations, Professions, and Social Attitudes

Kenrick explores the portrayal of occupations and professions on Roman tombs, noting a stark difference in social attitudes compared to modern times.  The inscriptions openly mentioned humble professions ("negotiator suarius," "negotiatrix frumentaria et leguminaria") without shame.  He contrasts this with the modern reluctance to similarly depict such professions on modern gravestones.  He notes the unusual instance of a mountebank's profession being recorded ("stupidus gregis urbani"), emphasizing the different social perception of such entertainers in antiquity.  The text also discusses the numerous inscriptions related to theatrical performers, highlighting the detailed categorization of roles and the sometimes boastful nature of the epitaphs.

## 10. Average Lifespan and Lapidary Style

Kenrick addresses the challenges in determining average lifespan from the inscriptions, emphasizing the incompleteness of the record. While he cites examples of long lifespans (102 and 100 years), he notes the prevalence of early deaths among military personnel. He then delves into the Roman lapidary style, contrasting its concise and emotive quality with the prolixity of modern epitaphs. The author points out the preference for brevity and simple expressions of affection, like "AVE LUCI, PRÆREPTE MATRI!" and "FILI BENE QUIESCAS! MATER TUA ROGAT TE UT ME AD TE RECIPIAS."

## 11.  Themes of Praise, Family Affection, and Conjugal Relations

The author discusses the qualities praised in the deceased:  homely virtues in women ("LANIFICA, PIA, PUDICA, FRUGI, CASTA, DOMISEDA"), intellectual accomplishments ("MORIBUS PARITER ET DISCIPLINA COETERIS FEMINIS EXEMPLO FUIT"), and military prowess in men.  He extensively explores parental regrets over the loss of children, the expression of filial piety by children, and the often-stated harmony of conjugal relationships ("CONJUX INCOMPARABILIS, CUM QUA VIXI XXX ANNOS SINE QUERELA"). The inscriptions reveal the depth of feeling towards family and spouses, often including vows against remarriage.

## 12. Divorce and Inscriptions on Animals

Kenrick then examines the impact of Roman divorce laws on sepulchral inscriptions, noting examples where a woman is commemorated jointly by her first and second husbands, suggesting amicable separation.  An inscription mentioning a son poisoned by his stepmother illustrates the less positive aspects of family dynamics.  He briefly touches upon the practice of commemorating beloved pets, citing an example of an inscription for a greyhound, showing the emotional bond with animals.

## 13. Religious Beliefs and Consolation

The final sections analyze the religious sentiments expressed in the inscriptions.  Kenrick notes the absence of resignation or acceptance of divine will, highlighting complaints against the gods ("MANUS LEBO CONTRA DEUM QUI ME INNOCENTEM SUSTULIT").  He contrasts the lack of Christian-like consolation with phrases like "solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris."  The frequent invocation of the _Dii Manibus_ (D.M.) is discussed, along with the ambiguities in interpreting this as evidence of a clear belief in an afterlife.  The author explores the range of perspectives, from Epicureanism ("AMICI DUM VIVIMUS VIVAMUS") to expressions of uncertain hope concerning the afterlife.

## 14.  The Decline of Traditional Roman Religion and the Rise of New Cults

Kenrick observes the decline of traditional Roman religion, evidenced by the absence of monuments to the major Roman gods in the Yorkshire Philosophical Society's Museum. The prevalence of cults dedicated to foreign deities (Serapis, Mithras, Brigantia) is seen as a sign of a spiritual vacuum and the search for new religious meaning. This points to a period of religious uncertainty and the increasing adoption of foreign religions before the rise of Christianity.

## 15. Contrast Between Pagan and Christian Monuments

Kenrick concludes by comparing the characteristics of pagan and Christian monuments. He emphasizes the contrast in style, materials, and inscriptions, reflecting the difference in social status and religious beliefs. Pagan monuments display elaborate craftsmanship and boastful inscriptions, while Christian ones are simpler, humbler, and focus on themes of faith and hope. This stark difference underscores the transformative power of Christianity in the Roman world.

## 16. Works on Inscriptions and Forgeries

The final section offers an overview of works on inscriptions and a cautionary note regarding forgeries, particularly those from the 16th century, highlighting the work of individuals like Pyrrhus Ligorius and Cyriac of Ancona. This section emphasizes the importance of critical analysis and the need for reliable sources when studying Roman inscriptions.  Kenrick concludes with examples of both authentic and fabricated inscriptions, underscoring the importance of scholarly rigor in this field.
