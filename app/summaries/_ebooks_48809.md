# Plans and Illustrations of Prisons and Reformatories: A Summary

## 1. The State of Prison Building in the Early 1920s

The book opens by noting a slowdown in prison construction during the previous seven years (1915-1922), with notable exceptions like Bellefonte (Pennsylvania), Sing Sing (New York), Statesville (Illinois), and Montgomery (Alabama).  New reformatories for women sprung up across numerous states, largely adopting cottage plans mirroring those used in industrial schools for delinquent girls.  County jail construction was also minimal, with the Hamilton County Jail (Cincinnati) cited as a model.  The report highlights the ongoing effort to modernize the Cook County Jail in Chicago, hampered by its inadequate size and design.  

## 2. The Cook County Jail Problem and Proposed Skyscraper Solution

The inadequacy of Cook County Jail, described as a "school of crime," is heavily emphasized.  An official 1919 report paints a grim picture of overcrowding, poor sanitation, and inhumane conditions, quoting,  “It is recognized as an insanitary, dark, overcrowded institution that is a disgrace to Cook County.... Twenty hours out of each twenty-four must be spent locked in the insanitary, dirty, crowded cell."  Dr. George W. Kirchwey's recommendations for addressing overcrowding and improving conditions are presented, including faster trials and release of non-dangerous prisoners.  Hastings H. Hart proposes a radical solution: a "skyscraper jail" for Chicago, utilizing the city's prevalent skyscraper architecture for a multi-storied facility with improved security, classification, and amenities like a roof garden for recreation.

## 3.  The New Sing Sing Prison: A Focus on Clinical and Psychiatric Services

The book details the groundbreaking New Sing Sing Prison, emphasizing its innovative approach to prisoner classification and rehabilitation.  Dr. Walter B. James stresses the new policy shift, viewing misbehavior as a societal problem analogous to disease, requiring scientific analysis and treatment. The Clinic Building, designed by Lewis F. Pilcher, is highlighted for its comprehensive physical and mental examination capabilities, including psychiatric assessment,  reflecting a move towards "scientific handling of the mental side of prisoners." 

## 4.  Pilcher's Vision for Sing Sing and the Importance of Individualization

Lewis F. Pilcher expands on the architectural and philosophical aspects of Sing Sing's design. He advocates for individualization, emphasizing the need to understand the prisoner's background and potential, quoting, “The dynamic unit of all human problems is the individual.” The prison is envisioned as a classification and distributing center, assigning prisoners to facilities best suited to their needs. The importance of a well-designed environment in influencing prisoner behavior is also stressed.  Pilcher calls for a national code for prison planning, to ensure humane conditions and reduce recidivism.


## 5.  The Sing Sing Registration and Clinical Processes

Pilcher meticulously details the process of prisoner registration and clinical evaluation at Sing Sing.  Upon arrival, prisoners are bathed, examined, and their belongings processed.  They undergo a series of physical, educational, and mental examinations, leading to initial classification.  The Registration Building is described, including the innovative design of the visitor reception area that prevents contraband smuggling while facilitating communication.  The clinical laboratory, with X-ray, surgical, dental, and psychiatric facilities, is presented as crucial for diagnosis and treatment.

## 6.  Wingdale Prison: Terraced Design and Psychological Implications

The Wingdale Prison's design is discussed by Lewis F. Pilcher, who connects its terraced layout to historical architectural precedents.  He notes that throughout history, elevated locations have been associated with power and authority. This principle is applied to the prison's design, with the most secure areas located at higher elevations, reflecting varying levels of prisoner trust and privilege, referencing the  "psychological arrangement of class housing" found in ancient civilizations.


## 7.  Kilby Prison: Alabama's Transition from Convict Leasing

The book describes Kilby Prison, Alabama's new penitentiary, designed to replace the convict leasing system.   The design, incorporating a high wall, towers, and electrified fencing, reflects the need for security in response to the outside cell model. The prison is explicitly designed as an industrial prison, with plans for a cotton mill and shirt factory to employ inmates and generate revenue, highlighting the shift from convict leasing to productive labor within the prison itself.

## 8.  Kilby Prison's Design and Construction Details

Martin J. Lide provides detailed architectural and engineering information about Kilby Prison.  He discusses the construction of the prison wall, cell blocks (single and multi-man cells), the detention and punitive cell houses, kitchen, mess hall, power plant, and hospital.  The emphasis is on economy and practicality, while still providing for ventilation and sanitation. The decision to use outside cells is justified, balancing concerns about security with the advantages in terms of hygiene and natural ventilation.

## 9.  Prison Farms for Women: The Cottage System

The book showcases the rising trend of prison farms for women, employing the cottage system. The Connecticut State Farm for Women at Niantic and the New Jersey Reformatory for Women at Clinton serve as case studies.  The text highlights the shift from traditional prison structures to a more humane, less restrictive environment, where the open design and focus on rehabilitation seem to have reduced escape attempts.  The Connecticut facility, with its three old farmhouses and a new reception building, demonstrates the simple, yet effective, nature of the cottage approach.

## 10.  Maternity Cottage at the New Jersey Reformatory and Proposed Prison Plans

The Caroline Bayard Wittpenn Maternity Cottage at the New Jersey Reformatory for Women is detailed, showcasing its design focused on maternal and infant care, with features like a nursery, diet kitchen, and pasteurizer.  The architecture is deliberately non-institutional, aiming to foster a positive atmosphere.  Finally, the book presents tentative plans for a state prison and a reformatory designed by Alfred Hopkins, demonstrating emerging trends in prison design, including emphasis on classification, separation of different prisoner groups, and the integration of industrial and agricultural work.


## 11. Westchester County Penitentiary: Corridor-Based Design

The Westchester County Penitentiary, designed by Alfred Hopkins, is presented as a model of the corridor-based prison plan. This system allows for indoor circulation between different building units, maximizing opportunities for segregation and classification of inmates, a sharp departure from traditional large cell blocks.  The design features outside cells, addressing concerns about privacy and ventilation. The text explains the process of prisoner intake, the separation of observation and regular cell blocks, and the unique design elements aimed at minimizing the institution's forbidding aspect.

## 12.  Detroit House of Correction:  A Modern, Humane Approach

The book concludes with a presentation of the Detroit House of Correction's plans, emphasizing the integration of administrative, reception, educational, and industrial facilities.  The design promotes self-respect by providing private cells, adequate recreation areas, and a modern industrial building resembling a standard factory.  The use of open courts and the avoidance of high walls enhance the overall atmosphere, creating a less oppressive environment for the inmates.  The Hawthorne School and Thorn Hill School's cottage designs complete the survey, demonstrating smaller-scale housing options that prioritize a less institutional feeling and greater staff supervision.
