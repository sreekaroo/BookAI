# Introdução à Archeologia da Peninsula Iberica: A Summary

Here's a chronological summary of the provided text, exceeding 10% of its original length, broken down into detailed paragraphs:


**1. The Dawn of Prehistoric Studies: Overcoming Anthropocentric Bias**

The book begins by highlighting the shift in historical and social sciences, particularly archeology, influenced by natural sciences' methods and principles.  It contrasts the historian's reliance on tradition with the naturalist's dependence on material evidence. The author emphasizes the objectivity of nature versus the fallibility of human accounts.  This sets the stage for discussing prehistoric archeology's similar methodology to natural history, relying entirely on the rigorous interpretation of observed remains, particularly regarding prehistoric artifacts like stone axes. These axes, once considered miraculous "thunderstones" (ceraunias), were gradually recognized as tools by scholars like Mercati, Jussieu, and Mahudel, challenging the prevailing anthropocentric belief in humanity's recent origin and immediate high civilization. The author critiques past explanations of these stones by Iberian authors, showcasing the prevailing misconceptions before the rise of scientific archeology.


**2. Establishing the Prehistoric Time Scale: The Three-Age System**

The text meticulously traces the development of the three-age system (Stone, Bronze, Iron Ages) in prehistoric studies.  Early observations of stone tools were often intertwined with myths and legends, as illustrated by the quotes from Lucretius, Marbodeo, and various medieval and early modern authors.  The author contrasts these traditional views with the emerging scientific understanding championed by scholars like Eccard and Goguet, who clearly defined the three ages based on material culture. The pivotal role of paleontology in verifying this system is highlighted, detailing the initial skepticism regarding the existence of human fossils and the gradual acceptance spurred by discoveries by Schmerling, Joly, and Boucher de Perthes. The book narrates the controversy surrounding Boucher de Perthes' findings, the international conferences to validate them, and the eventual shift in scientific opinion in France and England. The text concludes by situating the Iberian Peninsula within this broader European context, noting the later start of serious prehistoric studies in Spain and Portugal compared to other nations like Sweden, Germany, and England.


**3. Dating the Emergence of Humanity: The Quaternary and Beyond**

The author explores the geological timescale and its relevance to human history. A detailed table outlining the geological periods (Primordial, Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary) and their estimated durations is presented, emphasizing the relatively short duration of the Quaternary period, in which modern humans emerged.  The book discusses the immense thickness of sedimentary deposits (over 43 kilometers) and the relative durations of various geological ages.  The evidence for human existence in the Quaternary period is presented, including the co-occurrence of human artifacts and fossils of extinct megafauna.  The author also delves into the ongoing debate surrounding the possibility of human presence in earlier Tertiary periods, emphasizing the scarcity of conclusive evidence despite some promising finds.  Various methods for calculating the age of these deposits are examined, ranging from the study of Danish forest vegetation successions to fluvial sediment accumulation rates, and the erosion of river valleys. The author then delves into the discussion of the specific dating methods regarding the evidence in Spain and Portugal, highlighting the limitations of current knowledge.


**4.  The Stone Age: From Crude Tools to Artistic Expression**

The book details the subdivisions of the Stone Age into Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age) periods, noting the Iberian Peninsula's relative scarcity of Mesolithic finds and the unique characteristics of the Paleolithic site of San Isidro near Madrid, with evidence of extinct fauna alongside stone tools. The author acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the existence of an "Archeolithic" period in the Tertiary based on the findings of Carlos Ribeiro, questioning the definitive attribution of his collection of chipped quartzites and flints to human activity. The chapter discusses both direct (fossil bones) and indirect (evidence of tool use) proof of early humans, acknowledging the ongoing scientific debates.  The limitations of current data are emphasized, along with the contrast between the crudeness of Paleolithic tools and the clear progress in Neolithic toolmaking, ceramic production, and the beginnings of artistic expression.


**5.  Exploring Prehistoric Settlements and Their Artifacts: Kjokkenmoddings and More**

The chapter discusses the nature of prehistoric settlements, particularly comparing Iberian sites such as Argecilla and Cabeço da Arruda to the kjokkenmoddings of Denmark. It analyzes the artifacts found in these sites, including flint tools, arrowheads, spear points, and bone implements. The chapter thoroughly describes the crafting of flint knives, using examples from Argecilla and comparing them to those from Danish kjokkenmoddings. The discussion also extends to the interpretation of different tool types and their potential significance, mentioning the possibility of some flint knives serving more as symbolic objects than practical tools. The exploration of Castella a Velha's rich deposits, characterized by numerous bones and associated artifacts, highlights the potential for further discoveries and better understanding of the Neolithic period in Spain.


**6.  Cave Dwellings and Their Inhabitants: Evidence of Human Occupation**

This section explores cave dwellings, discussing their use by humans and animals and the importance of cave deposits in providing insight into prehistoric life. The author explains the formation of caves through geological processes and emphasizes the variety of finds within them.  The author contrasts the early, simplistic view of caves with the recent detailed study focusing on the position of fossils and artifacts to ascertain their contemporaneity. The text focuses on the different animal remains found in caves, outlining various theories on how these bones ended up within cave systems. The chapter examines the evidence for human occupation and possible cannibalism at sites like Cavillon, Sierra Cebollera, Gibraltar, Parpalló, Alhama de Granada, Albuñol, and Cesareda. This includes detailed descriptions of the finds, human remains, and the debate surrounding the interpretation of certain bone fractures as evidence of anthropophagy.  A counterargument is presented, suggesting alternative explanations for the fragmented nature of bones.


**7.  Megalithic Monuments: Menhirs, Dolmens, and Tumuli**

This chapter delves into megalithic monuments—menhirs, cromlechs, dolmens, and tumuli—correcting the earlier misconception of attributing them solely to Celts. The author provides detailed descriptions of these monument types and their distribution in the Iberian Peninsula and other parts of Europe. It contrasts the simplistic views of the past with the modern approaches to understanding the function of these structures. The chapter specifically discusses the varying forms and potential purposes of menhirs, their possible use as religious symbols or funerary markers, and the different interpretations of megalithic alignments and cromlechs. The text explores the enigma of rocking stones, presenting hypotheses on their potential role as altars or ritual sites.


**8.  Dolmens and Their Mysteries: Origins, Functions, and Interpretations**

The chapter focuses extensively on dolmens, examining the challenges in interpreting their purpose and origin.  It presents and critiques hypotheses by Bonstetten and Bertrand regarding the origin and dispersal of dolmens, highlighting the flaws in their theories based on geographical distribution and artifact finds. The author emphasizes the geographical distribution of dolmens, noting their prevalence near coastlines and their absence in certain inland regions. This leads to the hypothesis that dolmen construction was introduced by seafaring peoples.  The text examines the relationship between dolmens and Pelasgian constructions, analyzing the evidence for contemporaneity and contrasting cultures.  The chapter explores the different types of objects discovered within dolmens in Spain and Portugal, emphasizing the distinctive schist insignia, and comparing them to similar objects from Scandinavia.  The author proposes that dolmens served mainly as burial places and explores the possible reasons for the lack of evidence of metal tools in many Bronze Age dolmens.  The possibility that some stone tools were kept for ritual reasons rather than practicality is also explored.


**9.  The Metal Ages: Copper, Bronze, and Iron**

The chapter tackles the transition from the Stone Age to the Metal Ages.  It questions the common exclusion of a distinct Copper Age by many archeologists, analyzing hypotheses explaining the scarcity of copper artifacts in some regions.  It contrasts these views with the abundance of copper artifacts in the Iberian Peninsula, arguing for the existence of a Copper Age that may or may not have coincided with or directly preceded the Bronze Age. The abundance of copper artifacts in the Iberian Peninsula is highlighted, raising questions about the timeline of the Copper Age in relation to the Stone Age and the subsequent Bronze Age.  The chapter details copper and bronze artifacts discovered in Portugal, including axes, arrowheads, knives, saws, and swords, along with discussion of bronze and iron daggers from Galicia. The notably small size of handles on Bronze Age weapons is noted, leading to speculation about a shorter stature of the people who created them, connecting this to legends of pygmies.


**10.  Ethnic Origins: Tracing the Ancestry of Iberian Peoples**

This chapter addresses the ethnic origins of the Iberian Peninsula's inhabitants, focusing on the Finnic and Basque peoples and their agglutinative languages.  It explores the Turanian origin of the Finnic peoples and the debate about whether this origin is shared by the Basques, citing evidence from linguistics and anthropology. Retzius's hypothesis, based solely on cranial shape, is critically examined and refuted.  The author then discusses the ongoing debate regarding the Basque language and its possible connections to American languages, noting the diverse opinions amongst philologists. The chapter thoroughly examines the oldest human fossils found in Europe and the Iberian Peninsula—the Neanderthal and Gibraltar skulls—and the evidence found in Cabeço da Arruda, Cesareda, and Cueva de la Mujer, clarifying the diverse typologies that have been uncovered and the ongoing nature of their study. The author examines the Cro-Magnon race and its possible connection to modern-day Berbers, reinforcing the theory that the Cro-Magnon population could extend to the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa.


**11.  Further Examination of Ethnic Origins: Unraveling Iberian Complexity**

Continuing the investigation into Iberian ethnic origins, the author challenges the earlier hypothesis of a single, unified Iberian people and language, advocating for a more nuanced approach acknowledging multiple groups. The text contrasts this approach with Humboldt's earlier theory of a single, homogenous Iberian population, presenting evidence from linguistics and historical accounts of diverse customs, languages, and alphabets among different Iberian groups under Roman domination. The chapter explores the significance of the name "Iberia" and its possible connection to the Caucasus region, which previously was also known by this name, noting the linguistic and metalworking similarities, leading to the theory that the Iberian Peninsula was named after the region in the Caucasus. The analysis of texts from ancient authors is presented, highlighting the vagueness and contradictions in their accounts, underscoring the need for more robust methodologies, relying on philology and archeology to reconstruct the history of the Iberian peninsula.


**12. Synthesizing Evidence: Mediterranean and Atlantic Influences**

The chapter synthesizes findings from previous chapters, focusing on the historical and prehistorical migrations into the Iberian Peninsula. The author distinguishes two main migration routes: the Mediterranean and the Atlantic.  The Mediterranean route is linked to migrations from Western Asia and North Africa, while the Atlantic route is associated with migrations from Northwest Europe.  The distinct geographical distribution of dolmens in the Peninsula is presented as evidence of an Atlantic cultural influence, whereas the prevalence of Pelasgian constructions in eastern Spain and the islands points to a separate, Mediterranean influence.  This is highlighted in contrast with the distribution of other megalithic and cyclopean constructions, with the author noting the antinomy between the two. The author suggests that the exploration of copper mines and the development of a copper-based civilization predate the arrival of the Phoenicians. Finally, the unique features of the Basque language are discussed and a comparison of these with the languages of other regions. This section further develops the thesis that the earliest copper mining in several regions was contemporary and likely represents a wide-reaching Turanian influence. The author concludes by revisiting the unique position of the Romani people and their historical relevance, tying together the threads of the book's diverse perspectives to reach a conclusion about Iberian origins.
