# Leonardo da Vinci: A Chronological Journey

## Humble Beginnings in Vinci

Leonardo da Vinci, the multifaceted genius of the Italian Renaissance, was born in Vinci, a small town near Florence, around 1452. His full name, Leonardo di Ser Piero d'Antonio di Ser Piero di Ser Guido da Vinci, reflects his family's established lineage of notaries. His father, Ser Piero, a successful notary, later had eleven more children by subsequent wives.  His mother, Caterina, married Accabriga di Piero del Vaccha after Leonardo's birth. The text suggests that Ser Piero recognized Leonardo's exceptional talent early on, legitimatizing him despite his illegitimate status, perhaps even inspired by the later number of eleven apostles in his *Last Supper*.  Leonardo's birthplace still stands, today a home for a farmer and wine exporter.

## Apprenticeship with Verrocchio

Ser Piero, impressed by his son's artistic inclinations, sought the opinion of his friend Andrea del Verrocchio, a renowned sculptor, goldsmith, and artist.  Verrocchio's astonishment at Leonardo's drawings led to the young Leonardo's admission into Verrocchio's studio around 1469-1470. There, he encountered fellow artists like Botticelli and Lorenzo di Credi, though he quickly surpassed his peers.  The text highlights Leonardo's remarkable versatility, mastering not only painting but also sculpture, mathematics, engineering, and music. By 1472, at the age of twenty, he joined the Guild of Florentine Painters. The author notes that Leonardo's genius extended beyond art to encompass a wide range of scientific pursuits.

## Early Artistic Explorations in Florence

Leonardo's early works are few but remarkable. The "Annunciation" in the Louvre, initially attributed to Lorenzo di Credi, is now considered an early Leonardo work, painted around 1472. Another "Annunciation" in the Uffizi Gallery remains debated, possibly the work of Verrocchio instead. His earliest dated work, a pen-and-ink drawing titled "A Wide View over a Plain," from 1473, shows his unique left-handed, reversed writing style.  Further illustrating his precocious talent are his participation in the "Baptism of Christ" (where he painted a superior angel compared to his master's work) and his drawings such as the vigorous sketch of Bernardo Bandini (1479).  Unfinished works like the "St. Jerome in the Desert" reflect Leonardo's tendency to pursue multiple projects simultaneously.

## The Ambitious Milanese Period

Around 1482, Leonardo sought employment with Ludovico Sforza in Milan, outlining his diverse skills in a letter:  "Having...seen and pondered over the experiments made by those who pass as masters in the art of inventing instruments of war...I make so bold as to solicit...an opportunity of informing your excellency of some of my own secrets."  This highlights his multi-disciplinary approach, encompassing military engineering, architecture, sculpture, and painting.  In Milan, Leonardo produced the "Vierge aux Rochers" (Louvre), a distinctly Florentine work, followed by another version, the "Virgin of the Rocks" (National Gallery), likely painted in collaboration with Ambrogio da Predis. This period also saw his work on the colossal equestrian statue of Francesco Sforza, never completed but celebrated by contemporaries.


##  Masterpiece: The Last Supper

Between 1496 and 1498, Leonardo created his masterpiece, the "Last Supper," a fresco in the Refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie.  The text details the fresco's deterioration over centuries, noting numerous restorations and damage.  The author describes the dramatic depiction of the moment when Jesus announces his betrayal, capturing the apostles' diverse reactions. The quote, "'One of you shall betray me,'" serves as the emotional crux of the piece. The author also recounts a charming anecdote where Leonardo threatened to paint the features of an impatient Prior onto Judas. This highlights the dedication to his work and clashes that arose with patrons. Multiple copies exist, highlighting the importance of the piece.


## Beyond the Last Supper in Milan

The Milanese period also involved Leonardo's work as a general artificer for Ludovico Sforza, including designs for the Milan Cathedral and scenery for theatrical productions. He began his "Treatise on Painting," further demonstrating his theoretical understanding of art.  The text mentions Leonardo's involvement with the court life, including his possible portraits of Ludovico Sforza's mistresses, Cecilia Gallerani and Lucrezia Crivelli (the authorship of portraits attributed to him in this period is contested). Beatrice d'Este's death in 1497 profoundly impacted Ludovico, and this period foreshadows Leonardo's imminent departure from Milan.


##  Wanderings and the Mona Lisa

By 1499, political turmoil forced Leonardo to leave Milan. He worked briefly for Cesare Borgia, designing canals and fortifications.  Returning to Florence, he painted the famous "Mona Lisa" (Plate I) – "La Gioconda" in the Louvre–around 1503.  The text quotes Vasari's description of the portrait, emphasizing its realism and the efforts made to keep the sitter comfortable during sittings: "Whoever shall desire to see how far art can imitate nature may do so to perfection in this head...The eyes have the lustrous brightness and moisture which is seen in life..." The author also remarks upon the contrast between the divinely human head of Christ and the worldly charm of Mona Lisa.


## The Battle of Anghiari and Return to Milan

In 1504, Leonardo undertook a commission to paint the "Battle of Anghiari" for the Palazzo Vecchio. Though the fresco itself was lost,  the cartoon survives and is considered of great importance.  In 1506, he returned to Milan under French rule and, likely with assistants, painted "The Madonna, the Infant Christ, and St. Anne" (Plate VIII), a work based on earlier cartoons. This work is noted for its layering and complexity.


## Rome and Final Years in France

From 1513-1515, Leonardo resided in Rome, focusing on scientific pursuits rather than artistic commissions.  He later moved to France in 1516, where Francis I offered him generous patronage, though his artistic output dwindled due to age and declining health.  The text recounts his final years and death on May 2, 1519, in the arms of the King.


## Legacy and Influence

The author emphasizes Leonardo's profound influence on art and science, noting his innovative use of chiaroscuro and his prescient scientific insights. He was far ahead of his time, anticipating discoveries in fields ranging from anatomy to mechanics, leading the text to declare him a “SUPERMAN.”  His numerous notebooks and maxims further demonstrate the breadth of his intellect, concluding that his influence was felt through his pupils like Boltraffio and his descendants, with a lineage traced even to a peasant named Leonardo. His legacy is a testament to the universality and timelessness of his genius.
