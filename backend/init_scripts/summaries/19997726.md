# An Introduction to the Study of the Maya Hieroglyphs: A Chronological Summary

Here's a chronological summary of the provided text, exceeding 10% of its original length, broken down into detailed paragraphs:


## 1. The Maya Homeland and Early Civilization

The Maya inhabited the lowlands of Southern Mexico and Northern Central America, a region characterized by diverse geography and climate. The south featured abundant waterways and dense forests, while the north (Yucatan Peninsula) was drier, with limited water sources like *cenotes* (sinkholes).  The climate was tropical, with distinct wet and dry seasons.  The region provided ample resources, including diverse wildlife, making agriculture, hunting, and fishing significant aspects of their sustenance. While the Maya today are a diminished population, their ancestors, at the peak of their civilization,  represented a high point of New World intellectual achievement.


## 2. The Rise of Maya Cities (The Golden Age)

Maya civilization emerged from barbarism around the 1st or 2nd century CE.  The complexity of their earliest dated monuments (around the beginning of the Christian era), along with their highly developed calendar and hieroglyphic writing, points to centuries of preceding development. The text highlights this, emphasizing that "many centuries must have elapsed before the Maya hieroglyphic writing could have been developed to the highly complex stage where we first encounter it." The period from roughly the 2nd to the 6th century CE is considered the "Golden Age," marked by the flourishing of major cities like Palenque, Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras, Tikal, Naranjo, and Copan. These cities, spread across present-day Mexico and Central America, demonstrated significant artistic and architectural prowess, particularly in sculpture—a period comparable to the classical era of Greek art.


## 3. The Collapse of Southern Maya Civilization

The reasons for the decline and abandonment of the southern Maya cities around the end of the 6th century remain unclear. The text proposes two hypotheses:  displacement by migrating groups, or the natural collapse of the civilization.  Regardless of the cause, there's a clear chronological break in dated monuments after Cycle 9. The text notes, "Just after the close of Cycle 9 of Maya chronology, toward the end of the sixth century, there is a sudden and final cessation of dates in all the southern cities, apparently indicating that they were abandoned about this time."  This coincides with the colonization of Yucatan around the 5th century CE, potentially contributing to the decline of the south.


## 4.  Colonization of Yucatan and the Transitional Period

The colonization of Yucatan, marked by hardship and a struggle for survival in a less fertile environment, initially hindered artistic progress.  Early settlements, like Bakhalal, were short-lived. Chichen Itza, while initially successful, was eventually abandoned before the establishment of Chakanputun in the 8th century.  The text describes this as a "Transitional Period" before the Maya Renaissance. The description highlights the difficulties, stating, "The period of colonization, with the strenuous labor by which it was marked, was not conducive to progress in the arts. At first the struggle for bare existence must have absorbed in a large measure the energies of all, and not until their foothold was secure could much time have been available for the cultivation of the gentler pursuits."


## 5. The Maya Renaissance and the Triple Alliance

The Maya Renaissance began around the 11th century CE, characterized by renewed artistic expression, primarily in architecture.  Chichen Itza was reoccupied, and Mayapan and Uxmal were founded. In 1000 CE, these three cities formed a powerful confederacy, leading to a two-century period of relative peace and prosperity.  The text remarks, "Under the peaceful conditions which followed the formation of this confederacy for the next 200 years the arts blossomed forth anew. This was the second and last great Maya epoch."


## 6. The Fall of the Triple Alliance and Civil War

This period of peace ended around 1200 CE with a power struggle between the rulers of Chichen Itza and Mayapan, leading to war and the dissolution of the Triple Alliance.  Mayapan emerged as the dominant power, but its rule was marked by oppression, according to Spanish accounts.  The resulting discontent culminated in the sacking of Mayapan around the mid-15th century. The text quotes a native chronicle: "The chiefs of the country lost their power."


## 7. The Spanish Conquest and the End of Maya Independence

The Spanish arrived in 1517, beginning a protracted and violent struggle against the now fragmented Maya. The conquest was completed in 1541, marking the end of independent Maya history.


## 8. Maya Society: Customs and Beliefs

The Maya were described as tall, active, and strong, with practices like cranial deformation and scarification. Their clothing varied in complexity depending on social status.  Marriage customs included dowries and a period of work for the husband in his wife's family's home.  Divorce was common, and the community possessed a well-developed sense of justice with various systems of punishment.


## 9. Maya Government and Religion: A Theocracy

The northern Maya's government was based on a hierarchical system with hereditary chiefs (*halach uinics*) and subordinate officials (*batabs*, *ahkulels*).  A theocratic structure is inferred for the southern Maya, with the highest priest also holding the chief civil authority.  Both the north and south likely shared aspects of a modified feudal system. The text notes the significance of the hereditary high priest (*ahaucan mai*),  whose power stemmed from interpreting the will of the gods.  Religious practices were central to Maya life, with numerous ceremonies dedicated to a pantheon of gods, including Itzamna (chief deity), Kukulcan (Feathered Serpent), Ahpuch (God of Death), and Yum Kaax (Maize God), reflecting a dualistic worldview of opposing forces.  The text explains, "In short, religion was the foundation upon which the structure of the Maya civilization was reared."


## 10. The Maya Writing System: A Blend of Phoneticism and Ideography

Maya writing was found on various materials, most commonly stone monuments (*stelæ* and altars) and the few surviving codices (fiber-paper books).  The writing system is complex, involving glyphs arranged in columns read in pairs. Early attempts to decipher the writing using purely phonetic or ideographic interpretations failed. The text explains the challenges, stating,  "In a graphic system composed largely of ideographic elements it is extremely difficult to determine the meanings of the different signs, since little or no help is to be derived from varying combinations of elements as in a phonetic system." It highlights that Maya writing utilized a blend of ideographic and phonetic elements,  described as *ikonomatic* or rebus writing for personal and place names. The text clarifies the consensus on this matter, stating, "The theory now most generally accepted is, that while chiefly ideographic, the glyphs are sometimes phonetic, and that although the idea of a glyphic alphabet must finally be abandoned, the phonetic use of syllables as illustrated above must as surely be recognized."


## 11. Deciphering the Codices: Astronomy and Ritual

The codices primarily focus on time reckoning, featuring astronomical calculations (like Venus and lunar cycles),  prophecies based on the 260-day *tonalamatl* (sacred year), and rituals. The text notes Förstemann's work and his interpretation of the *tonalamatl* as prophetic. A quote emphasizes this, saying, "Doctor Förstemann believed that this 260-day period was employed by the priests in casting horoscopes and foretelling the future of individuals, classes, and tribes, as well as in predicting coming political events and natural phenomena."  The codices also contain astronomical data, highlighting the Maya's advanced knowledge. The text remarks on the accuracy of lunar calculations, stating, "so accurate are the calculations involved that although they cover a period of nearly 33 years the total number of days recorded (11,959) is only 89/100 of a day less than the true time computed by the best modern method."  The "serpent numbers" represent extremely long periods of time, culminating in depictions of the world's end, hinting at apocalyptic beliefs.


## 12. Deciphering the Inscriptions: A Focus on History

The inscriptions on stone monuments are primarily viewed as historical records,  with most dates likely corresponding to contemporaneous events.  The text establishes this using several arguments:  the periodicity of monument erection (especially at Quirigua, with 1800-day intervals), the correlation between stylistic analysis and chronological order, and the distribution of dates across time, reflecting the growth and decline of Maya civilization. The text refers to this growth, stating, "The increasing number of monuments by ten-year periods is shown…The increasing number of the monuments by ten-year periods is shown in plate 4, where the passage of time (i.e., the successive ten-year periods) is represented from left to right, and the number of dates in each ten-year period from bottom to top."  Supporting evidence comes from early Spanish accounts that describe the erection of stones to record historical events.  The text cites one such account saying, "Their lustras having reached five in number, which made twenty years, which they call a katun, they place a graven stone on another of the same kind laid in lime and sand in the walls of their temples and the houses of the priests, as one still sees to-day in the edifices in question, and in some ancient walls of our own convent at Merida…"


## 13. Maya Time Reckoning:  Calendrical Systems

The Maya calendar system is incredibly intricate, involving several interlocking cycles. It starts with the *kin* (day), which cycles through 20 named days (Table I).  These are combined with numerical coefficients (1-13) to form the *tonalamatl* (260-day cycle). The *haab* (365-day solar year) is composed of 18 *uinals* (20-day periods) plus 5 unnamed days. The combination of the *tonalamatl* and *haab* produces the Calendar Round (18,980 days or 52 years).  The text explains, "The Calendar Round was the real basis of Maya chronology, since its 18,980 dates included all the possible combinations of the 260 days with the 365 positions of the year."  Beyond this, the Long Count uses a vigesimal (base-20) system to record time over vast periods (Table VIII), progressing through *kins*, *uinals*, *tuns*, *katuns*, *cycles*, and *great cycles*.  The system is based on a starting date, 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu.


## 14. Maya Arithmetic and Numeration: Two Systems

The Maya had two distinct numerical systems: a bar-and-dot system (normal forms) and a head-variant system. The bar-and-dot system used dots (1) and bars (5) to represent numbers 1-19. The head-variant system employed distinct head glyphs for numbers 0-19, and higher numbers were formed by combining these heads. The text clarifies this, explaining, "The normal forms of the numerals may be compared to our Roman figures, since they are built up by the combination of certain elements which had a fixed numerical value…"  Higher numbers were expressed by applying multipliers (0-19) to the basic time periods.


## 15.  Maya Number Systems in Inscriptions and Codices

In inscriptions, the first method of numeration was used predominantly, where glyphs were used to denote time periods. The second method is mainly found in the codices, where they utilize a positional system with values depending on placement, similar to our decimal system but based on 20. The text highlights this distinction, explaining,  "The first of these methods is rarely found outside of the inscriptions, while the second is confined exclusively to the codices."  The text explains the positional system, stating, "Their ratio of increase was 20 in all positions except the third. The value of these positions increased with their distance from the bottom, according to the terms of the vigesimal system shown in Table VIII." The differences in how numbers were recorded in inscriptions and codices are detailed in Table XII.


## 16.  Solving Maya Numbers and Deciphering Methods

The text details the steps involved in solving Maya numbers, particularly in the context of time calculations.  The process involves: (1) reducing higher-order units to the base unit (*kins*), (2) identifying the starting date (often 4 Ahau 8 Cumhu), (3) determining the direction of the count (forward or backward, indicated by a "backward sign" in codices), and (4) performing the calculation itself.  The text provides formulas and examples for these steps. A key element is identifying the terminal date, which acts as a check on the calculations.  The text states, "If after having worked out the terminal date of a given number according to these rules the terminal date thus found should differ from that actually recorded…we must accept one of the following alternatives: (1) There is an error in our own calculations; or (2) There is an error in the original text; or (3) The case in point lies without the operation of our rules."


## 17. Analyzing Initial Series Inscriptions

The text presents numerous examples of Initial Series inscriptions, providing detailed analyses of their glyphs and coefficients.  This section emphasizes identifying the introducing glyph, period glyphs (normal and head-variant forms), and numerals (bar-and-dot and head-variant systems) and calculating the resultant date.  The Supplementary Series, which often accompanies Initial Series, is mentioned as an area needing further research. Examples from various sites (Quirigua, Copan, Naranjo, Palenque, Tikal, Yaxchilan) highlight differences in stylistic variations and potential errors.

## 18. Secondary Series and Period-Ending Dates in Inscriptions

This section delves into the interpretation of inscriptions containing Secondary Series (numbers indicating the interval between known dates) and Period-Ending dates (dates signifying the end of a particular period).  Examples from Quirigua,  Piedras Negras, and Copan demonstrate the techniques involved in calculating the initial series value for the secondary dates.  The text emphasizes how these secondary series can determine the precise positions of dates in the Long Count and their interrelationships. The use of period-ending dates, especially for katuns and cycles, is explained.


## 19.  Calendar-Round Dates and Errors in Inscriptions

The section discusses Calendar-Round dates (dates only precise within the 52-year cycle) and their limitations in determining precise positions in the Long Count.  The use of Calendar-Round dates is highlighted. Finally, the text addresses potential errors in the original inscriptions, offering examples where calculations reveal discrepancies with the recorded glyphs.  Such errors are analyzed, showing that they commonly involve incorrect numerals rather than incorrect glyphs themselves.

## 20. The Codices: Tonalamatl Cycles and Initial Series

The final section shifts to the analysis of Maya codices.  The text focuses on deciphering *tonalamatls*, explaining how the arrangement of day signs, red coefficients, and black distance numbers defines the 260-day cycle and its subdivisions.   Several examples from the Dresden and Tro-Cortesianus codices are analyzed. The text explains how the codices employ a more abbreviated method of recording *tonalamatls* compared to the inscriptions. This involves omitting some day signs and using single coefficients to represent several days within a series. Finally, Initial Series in the codices (present only in the Dresden Codex) are explained. The differences between the codices' use of Initial Series and their use in the inscriptions are summarized.  The text highlights the use of the positional system for expressing numbers in codices' Initial Series.  The challenging task of determining the precise contemporaneous dates of the codices is discussed, referencing different interpretations by scholars, with the conclusion emphasizing a preference for later dating for the Dresden Codex based on historical and stylistic evidence.  The text also details the analysis of Serpent numbers (unique to the Dresden Codex) and ascending series, both of which present significant challenges in interpretation.
