# Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration, Volume V: A Summary

This summary condenses the content of Volume V of the *Cyclopedia of Commerce, Accountancy, Business Administration*, focusing on key concepts and providing illustrative examples.

## 1. Wholesale Business Accounting:  Organizing the Ledger and Key Records

The volume emphasizes the advantages of a divided ledger system for wholesale businesses, separating accounts into purchase, sales, and general ledgers. This allows for efficient posting and error detection.  Controlling accounts in the general ledger summarize the balances of the subsidiary ledgers (purchase and sales), providing a high-level overview of receivables and payables.  The text introduces the use of standardized order blanks, filed in binders, streamlining order management.  The order blanks serve as the foundation for invoice creation and sales recording. A sales book, further enhanced with columns for cash and sales ledger entries, and departmental sales distribution, aids in tracking sales data. A combined purchase book/invoice register provides a detailed record of purchases, including terms, discounts, due dates, and payment details. A columnar cash book, functioning as a cash journal, classifies receipts and expenditures, facilitating monthly posting.  The text stresses the importance of subdividing the expense account for better cost analysis, illustrating the use of petty cash vouchers.


## 2. Sample Wholesale Transactions and Ledger Demonstration

A detailed example walks the reader through the bookkeeping process of a wholesale men's and boys' clothing business. This practical example shows how journal entries, cash book entries, sales book entries, and invoice register entries are made and then posted to the ledger. The illustration includes the treatment of protested paper and a thorough explanation of posting to the purchase, sales, and general ledgers, including closing the accounts into trading and profit and loss accounts. Statements are prepared from the sales and purchase ledgers demonstrating that the totals agree with their respective controlling accounts in the general ledger.


## 3. Single Entry Bookkeeping:  Limitations and Conversion

While advocating for the superiority of double-entry bookkeeping, the text acknowledges the continued use of single-entry in some businesses. It emphasizes that single-entry is _not recommended_ due to its limitations, primarily the absence of property accounts, providing an incomplete picture of the business. The text details the distinctive features of single-entry, which only tracks personal accounts (customers and creditors) and usually cash, omitting crucial information like merchandise inventory, expenses, and assets. It outlines the books used in single-entry: journal, cash book, and ledger, along with auxiliary books like order books and bill books.  The rules for debit and credit remain the same as in double-entry, but are applied only to personal accounts and cash.  The chapter highlights the lack of a trial balance in single-entry, outlining a method of proving the ledger's accuracy by comparing the difference between debits and credits in the ledger with the difference in the books of original entry. A sample retail grocery business showcases the single-entry process with a step-by-step demonstration.


## 4.  Converting Single-Entry to Double-Entry Bookkeeping

A practical guide outlines the process of converting a single-entry system to a double-entry system. The first step involves creating a statement of assets and liabilities. This statement is then journalized and posted to the ledger, debiting assets and crediting liabilities. The difference is credited to the proprietor's account.  The text then explains how to handle the conversion for both sole proprietorships and partnerships, emphasizing the importance of determining the present worth of the business.  For partnerships, the necessary adjustments, similar to those in double-entry, are made and posted to the partners' accounts.


## 5. Commission and Brokerage Business Accounting:  Types of Agents and Shipments

The text moves to the complexities of commission and brokerage businesses, explaining the different roles of commission merchants (who handle goods physically), merchandise brokers (who act as agents without handling goods), and manufacturers' agents (who sell goods on behalf of manufacturers). The section then focuses on shipments: how goods are sent to commission agents, and how accounts are opened for each shipment.  The text illustrates the creation of Agents' or Factors' Accounts, which are treated as personal accounts, reflecting the agent's responsibility for the funds, even in the case of insolvency.   It explains the concept of consignments from the broker's perspective and introduces the use of Principal's Accounts and Commission Accounts.


## 6. Produce Shipper's Books and Commission Merchant's Books

A detailed explanation of bookkeeping for produce shippers is provided.  The necessary books are the purchase book, shipment book, shipment ledger, cash book, journal, and general ledger. The shipment book is a book of original entry for shipments, showing details of each shipment.  The shipment ledger tracks individual shipment accounts, while the columnar cash book facilitates tracking shipment expenses and net proceeds.  The text demonstrates how the shipment ledger account functions as a controlling account, summarizing all shipment activities.  A journal with additional columns for profits (and potential losses) is shown.  The treatment of actual sales alongside commission sales is addressed. The section then shifts to commission merchants' bookkeeping, outlining the use of receiving books, cash books, consignment ledgers, sales books, sales ledgers, journals, and general ledgers. The importance of lot numbers for tracking consignments is emphasized, along with the process of posting net proceeds, expenses, and commissions to consignment accounts.  The chapter concludes with a detailed illustrative example using this system.


## 7. Storage Accounting: Warehouse Receipts and Charge Methods

This section explores storage accounting, focusing on the role of warehouse receipts as negotiable instruments representing ownership of stored goods.  Two methods of calculating storage charges are explained: simple storage (charging for each quantity withdrawn) and average storage (charging for the average time goods are stored). The text stresses the need for detailed storage records showing receipts, deliveries, and storage charges, providing illustrative examples of storage records and statements.


## 8. Advanced Single-Entry Techniques:  Profit Determination, Ledger Proof, and Specialized Forms

The chapter revisits single-entry bookkeeping, providing methods for determining profits by taking inventory and creating a statement of assets and liabilities.  The text details methods of proving the accuracy of the ledger without a trial balance, comparing ledger differences with the differences from the books of original entry.  It then introduces the use of reverse or slip posting, a method of providing a continuous check on posting accuracy. The chapter moves on to demonstrate various specialized accounting forms such as loose-leaf and card ledgers (with different indexing methods), tabular ledgers, and balance ledgers designed for different business needs. The advantages and disadvantages of each style are discussed.  The section also illustrates detailed cash books and tabular sales books tailored for various industries, including sales recapitulation sheets designed for departmental and sales-person sales tracking.  Pay-roll record forms are shown that handle both day and piece work in multiple departments.


## 9. Stock Brokers' Accounts:  Margin, Clearing Houses, and Ring Settlements

The volume delves into the accounting methods of stock brokers, emphasizing the importance of precise bookkeeping due to the high volume and complexity of transactions. It covers the concepts of margin accounts, the role of interest charges, and the procedures for handling stock purchases and sales.   The text explains the roles of clearing houses and ring settlements (offsetting transactions) in simplifying daily settlements. The specific commodities handled (stocks, grains, etc.) are listed, along with a discussion of "cornering the market" and the significance of wire communications in executing orders.


## 10.  Stock Brokers' Books and Forms: A Detailed Overview

A detailed examination of the accounting forms and books used by stock brokers is presented. This includes order blanks, debit and credit slips, daily record sheets for stock and grain transactions, grain commission journal sheets, stock records, and various ledger types (stock ledger and customers' ledger). The text explains how the general cash book and its subsidiary ledgers are used, along with the treatment of office cash disbursements.  Margin books for tracking customer account balances are detailed.  The text concludes with a glossary of common board of trade terms, and a discussion of statement preparation and various billing machine features, including special characters, tabulators, and the integration of computing machines.  The volume ends with a discussion of compound forms in billing,  methods used in retail dry goods billing, and the use of colored sheets to streamline order handling and department processing.
