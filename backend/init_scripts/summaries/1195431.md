# A Summary of *Kumogata Monshou* (The Nebuly Coat) by John Meade Falkner

Here's a chronological summary of the provided text, exceeding 10% of its original length, broken down into detailed paragraphs:

**1. Sir George Farquhar's Concerns and the Prologue:** The story begins with Sir George Farquhar, a multifaceted individual—architect, author, antique dealer, and co-owner of Farquhar & Farquhar—instructing his subordinate, Westray, about the upcoming restoration of Caran Cathedral.  Farquhar expresses deep disdain for the National Heritage Preservation Society, whom he believes are using his company for publicity, and warns Westray to expect criticism regardless of the quality of their work. He emphasizes meticulous care for the south aisle roof and choir vault, while mentioning the long-neglected central tower's structural issues, which are to remain unaddressed for budgetary reasons.  He also instructs Westray to contact the parish priest, a "foolish man" unfit for his role.  The prologue establishes the central conflict: professional integrity versus bureaucratic hurdles and social complexities.

**2. Caran: A Forgotten Port and its Railroad Connection:** Chapter One introduces Caran, once a bustling port but now two miles inland due to silting.  The town's economic decline led to land reclamation, creating Caran Flats, a salt marsh pasture.  The unpredictable nature of the sea and river continues to threaten the reclaimed land.  Caran's connection to the outside world was initially limited to a horse-drawn carriage service until Sir Joseph Callow, a respected local member of parliament, advocated for a railway branch line, which proved to be only marginally more convenient than the previous system.  This sets the stage for Westray's arrival and the central mystery surrounding the cathedral.

**3. Westray's Arrival and First Impressions of Caran Cathedral:** Westray, frugal in travel arrangements, arrives in Caran on a rainy afternoon. He finds the town deserted save for a few elderly railway workers.  He takes a horse-drawn carriage to the Cathedral, where he is initially overwhelmed by its grandeur and mystery, shrouded in rain and mist. The imposing scale of the cathedral, far exceeding his expectations, is highlighted:  “The rain, falling heavily, the spray bursting into mist above the roof, the steam rising from the ground, invested everything with an unseen yet perceptible veil, blurring the outlines like a gauze curtain used on a stage."

**4. Introduction to the Cathedral's Key Figures:**  Inside the cathedral, Westray is introduced to Canon Parkin, the parish priest, who boasts about his relationship with Sir George Farquhar,  Mr. Sharnol (the organist), Dr. Enifer (the local doctor), and Mr. Jolliffe (a shopkeeper and church warden).  The descriptions of these individuals—Parkin’s vanity, the doctor and organist's subtle disdain for Parkin, and Jolliffe’s humility— foreshadow the social dynamics that will shape the narrative.

**5. The Cathedral's History and Initial Inspection:** Canon Parkin leads a tour, highlighting the Norman-style nave, built in 1135 by Walter le Bec, and the impressive crossing arch. Westray notices, however, cracks in the north and south sides of the tower, reminding him of the architectural adage, "Arches never sleep."  The organist also expresses concerns about the tower's stability. Parkin dismisses the concerns with a self-serving anecdote, highlighting his own cleverness in avoiding discussions about the tower's structural integrity with Sir George Farquhar. Westray notes his concerns privately, especially about the tower.

**6. Whispers of the Past and the Nebuly Coat:**  The conversation shifts to the history of the church, with the clerk recounting stories about the previous Lord Brandrammer, highlighting his misfortunes and family conflicts.  The discussion leads to the Nebuly Coat, the Brandrammer family crest, prominently displayed on a stained-glass window. The organist identifies the crest (“It's the Brandrammer coat of arms... Barry nebuly of six, argent and vert”), and hints at the strange tales associated with it, promising Westray will become familiar with it during his stay in Caran.

**7. Westray's Lodging and Encounters with Sharnol:** Westray is directed to Mr. Sharnol's lodging, the Bellevue Lodge, a once-grand house now somewhat dilapidated.  Sharnol, described as "foolish, silly, and terribly timid," reveals more about the history of the building and its connection to a local legend. They briefly observe a Creole woman singing in a nearby beer hall, adding a layer of local color to the setting. Sharnol's eccentricities and anxieties are made apparent through several comments, such as:  "I don't go down this way at night. I wouldn't have come tonight if you hadn't been with me."

**8.  The Nebuly Coat's Significance and Family Secrets:** At Sharnol's lodging, Westray learns about Martin Jolliffe, the organist's brother, and his delusional belief that he was a Brandrammer.  Sharnol recounts Martin’s life, his abandonment by his mother, his academic success, and his obsessive search for his real father, which was fueled by the family crest and culminated in his life-long delusion. This reveals a connection between the Nebuly Coat and the Jolliffe/Brandrammer families.  Sharnol's  comment, "I sometimes think I wish I'd never known about that coat of arms," hints at a deeper mystery.

**9. Westray's Observations and the Cathedral's Structure:** Chapter Three shifts to Westray's daily life and his observations of Caran from his room at Bellevue Lodge. He notes the landscape's beauty and contrasts it with the decay of the old town. He finds the furnishings of his room to be somewhat distasteful, particularly a gaudy painting of flowers, deciding he will request its removal. He encounters Anastasia, the niece of Miss Jolliffe, the lodging house owner, noting her refined appearance.

**10. The Painted Nebuly Coat and Miss Jolliffe's Dilemma:** The focus turns to Miss Jolliffe and her struggle with Martin's debts. She receives a letter from an art dealer, Bonton & Latheworth, offering £50 for the floral painting, but is reluctant to sell it due to its sentimental value and the belief it holds significant worth. Westray attempts to persuade her to remove the painting, but her sentimental attachment to the painting, linked to her late brother and mother, prevents her from doing so. This highlights the conflict between the practical and sentimental value of objects.

**11. The Ongoing Cathedral Restoration:** A month passes. The restoration work progresses, but Westray's concern about the cathedral's structural integrity, particularly the central tower, remains. Sir George Farquhar visits and inspects the tower, dismissing Westray's concerns. The history of the cathedral is briefly discussed, connecting it to the downfall of the Sherman family who acquired the land after the dissolution of the Caran monastery.


**12.  The Clerk's Tales and the Brandrammer Legacy:** Westray continues his work, learning more about the cathedral's past from the clerk. The clerk recounts a detailed story about Martin Jolliffe's mother, Sophia, her abandonment of her family, and her mysterious reappearance years later at a market where she mysteriously purchased horses for a significantly inflated price. This reinforces the recurring theme of deception and hidden truths related to the Brandrammer family.

**13. The Mysterious Tenor and the Unanswered Questions:** A stranger attends an afternoon service at the cathedral and unexpectedly displays remarkable skill as a tenor singer.  The organist, Sharnol, expresses curiosity about the tenor, eventually learning his identity as Lord Brandrammer.  This meeting reinforces the mystery surrounding Lord Brandrammer and his true motives.

**14. Lord Brandrammer's Generous Offer and its Fallout:** Lord Brandrammer unexpectedly offers to cover all costs for the cathedral's restoration, creating ripples of confusion and resentment among Caran's residents.  Canon Parkin, particularly, is offended by Lord Brandrammer's approach and his bypassing of Parkin's authority. Westray, elated by this development, shares the news with others, except for Canon Parkin, leading to further intrigue.

**15.  Anastasia and Lord Brandrammer's Secret:** Anastasia encounters Lord Brandrammer, who reveals he was waiting to see her. He proposes marriage to her, but she reveals a hidden fact about her family history, casting doubt on her true identity and preventing their union.  This introduces a new layer of complexity to the family's secrets and their relationship to the Brandrammer legacy.

**16.  Westray's Rejection and Renewed Investigation:** Westray's proposal to Anastasia is rejected, causing him emotional distress. This leads to a renewed focus on the investigation of Martin Jolliffe's papers.  He discovers a hidden painting beneath the floral painting Miss Jolliffe possessed, revealing a portrait of the previous Lord Brandrammer. The discovery of Martin's birth certificate further unveils the shocking truth of Lord Brandrammer's illegitimate lineage.


**17. The Unveiling of the Truth and its Consequences:** Westray's discovery of the hidden portrait and documents establishes Lord Brandrammer's illegitimacy and casts doubt on his current title. He contemplates revealing this information but ultimately decides to inform Lord Brandrammer directly. This climax sets up the final confrontation between Westray and Lord Brandrammer.

**18. The Confrontation at Fording:**  Westray travels to Fording to confront Lord Brandrammer, who receives the revelation of the discovered evidence calmly.  The story concludes with the collapse of Caran Cathedral's tower, highlighting the fragility of human constructs and the consequences of concealed truths.

**19. The Aftermath and Resolution:**  The catastrophic collapse of the cathedral tower is attributed to the weakened structure. Lord Brandrammer, despite being exposed as an illegitimate heir, rebuilds the tower. Westray, having resigned from his position, is appointed guardian of the young Brandrammer heir.  The epilogue concludes with the ongoing legacy of the Brandrammer family and the lingering mystery surrounding the Nebuly Coat.  The translator's afterword provides insightful details about the translation process and sources consulted, adding further context to the narrative.
