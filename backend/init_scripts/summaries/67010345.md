# The Science of Getting Rich: A Summary

## I. The Inherent Right to Riches

Wattles begins by asserting the fundamental right of every individual to be rich, not in a figurative sense, but materially wealthy.  He argues that true success in life—the full development of mind, body, and soul—requires ample resources. Poverty, he contends, hinders this development, preventing access to the necessities and luxuries that contribute to a complete life. He stresses that wanting riches isn't inherently wrong; it's a desire for a more abundant life, a natural human aspiration.  "The object of all life is development; and everything that lives has an inalienable right to all the development it is capable of attaining," he writes.  This right to life necessitates having the means to fulfill one's potential, which inevitably requires wealth.

## II. The Existence of a Science of Getting Rich

The core argument of the book is the existence of a scientific method for acquiring wealth.  Wattles posits that getting rich isn't random or solely dependent on luck, environment, talent, or thrift. Instead, it’s a matter of understanding and following specific laws. He uses examples of individuals in similar environments or professions, where one prospers while the other fails, to prove that getting rich is a result of "doing things in a Certain Way."  He emphasizes that this "Certain Way" isn't reserved for the elite but is accessible to anyone with sufficient understanding and commitment.

## III. Dispelling the Myth of Monopolized Opportunity

Wattles challenges the notion that opportunity is limited or controlled by the wealthy elite.  He points out that while some sectors may be saturated, countless others remain open for innovation and development.  He uses the examples of burgeoning industries like electric railways and aerial transportation to illustrate how new opportunities constantly emerge.  He refutes the idea that workers are "kept down" by industrial giants, arguing that their collective poverty results from a lack of understanding and adoption of the "Certain Way."  "No man is kept poor because opportunity has been taken away from him; because other people have monopolized the wealth, and have put a fence around it," he states.  The potential for wealth is virtually limitless, he argues, as nature's resources are practically inexhaustible.

## IV. The Power of Thought as the Foundation

The first principle in Wattles' science of getting rich is the power of thought.  He emphasizes the monistic theory—that all things originate from a single, thinking substance—and that thought shapes reality.  "Thought is the only power which can produce tangible riches from the Formless Substance," he asserts.  This substance responds to the thoughts of man, shaping itself according to those thoughts.  He argues that man can influence this substance directly through focused thought, creating new forms and bringing about desired outcomes.  Wattles establishes three fundamental propositions: the existence of a thinking substance, thought's ability to create form, and man's power to shape reality through thought.

## V. Harmonizing with the Purpose of the Universe

The author emphasizes the importance of aligning one's desires with the universe's inherent purpose: the expansion of life.  He refutes the notion of a deity that promotes poverty or self-sacrifice, arguing instead that the universe seeks fuller expression through all its creations, including humans.  He states that the desire for riches is itself a manifestation of this life-force seeking fulfillment.  "The desire for riches is simply the capacity for larger life seeking fulfillment; every desire is the effort of an unexpressed possibility to come into action."  This inherent desire for growth and abundance means the universe is inherently supportive of one's pursuit of wealth.

## VI. The Mechanism of Receiving Riches

Wattles explains how riches are obtained, not through exploitation or competition, but through creation and giving more than one takes. He emphasizes the importance of adding use value to transactions, ensuring that everyone benefits from interactions.  He contrasts the morally flawed approach of taking advantage of others with a more ethical path of offering significant use value in exchange for money.  The process involves holding a clear mental image of what one wants, along with unshakable faith and gratitude.  Riches are not magically manifested, he asserts, but rather, the thoughts set in motion the creative forces within the universe, causing men's actions to indirectly bring about the desired results.  He uses the example of obtaining a sewing machine—it wouldn't materialize out of thin air, but one's unwavering belief will influence circumstances that lead to acquiring it.

## VII. The Importance of Gratitude

A crucial element in the process is gratitude.  Wattles explains that gratitude creates a harmonious connection between the individual and the Formless Substance, fostering the flow of abundance.  He argues that a grateful attitude draws one closer to the source of wealth and that this connection is essential for manifesting desires.  He emphasizes that the lack of gratitude breaks this vital connection and prevents the arrival of blessings. He quotes scripture: “Draw nigh unto God, and He will draw nigh unto you,” highlighting the psychological truth behind this principle. Gratitude is also emphasized as a way to avoid the negative thoughts of dissatisfaction that hinder the creative process.

## VIII. The Art of Thinking in the Certain Way

To effectively harness the creative power, one must think in a "Certain Way." This involves developing a clear and definite mental image of the desired outcome, combined with unwavering purpose and faith.  "You must form a clear and definite mental picture of what you want; you cannot transmit an idea unless you have it yourself," Wattles writes.  This mental picture should be held consistently in mind, with a strong belief that it is already one's possession.  He also cautions against thinking negatively about poverty or focusing on limitations.  He urges readers to replace anxieties with faith and gratitude.

## IX. The Proper Use of Willpower

Wattles clarifies the appropriate use of willpower.  He strictly cautions against using it to manipulate or control others, emphasizing its ethical use for self-discipline.  "You have no right to use your will power upon another person, even ‘for his own good’," he asserts.  The correct application of will is in directing one's own thoughts and actions, consistently aligning them with the vision and purpose.  He stresses the importance of maintaining unwavering faith, warning against the negative impact of doubt and fear, which can disrupt the creative process. He explains that doubt and fear create negative impressions, while unwavering faith and purpose create positive impressions upon Formless Substance.

## X.  Efficient Action in the Present Moment

Wattles emphasizes the importance of combining thought with action. It's not enough to simply visualize wealth; one must take concrete steps in the present to create the desired outcome.  "By thought you can cause the gold in the hearts of the mountains to be impelled toward you; but it will not mine itself, refine itself, coin itself into double eagles, and come rolling along the roads seeking its way into your pocket," he explains.  Action must be efficient, focusing on performing every task to the best of one's ability.  He advocates for doing all that can be done each day but emphasizes the quality over quantity of work, focusing on efficiency over sheer volume.  This efficient action, powered by faith and purpose, will set in motion the forces necessary to receive one's desired outcomes.


## XI. Finding and Thriving in the Right Business

Wattles addresses choosing the right vocation, suggesting that individuals should ideally align their work with their natural talents and desires.  However, he also emphasizes that talent can be developed, making success possible in any field. "You can get rich in ANY business," he states.  He encourages pursuing work that is both satisfying and aligns with one's strengths, but warns against hasty decisions when changing careers. Growth and steady progress are prioritized over impulsive actions.  He advises waiting patiently for opportunities to appear, rather than rushing into questionable ventures.

## XII.  Impressing Others with Increase

Wattles describes the importance of projecting an aura of increase and advancement in all interactions.  Whether in business transactions or social encounters, one should convey the sense that they are progressing and are able to help others progress as well.  "The key-thought of all your efforts must be to convey to their minds the impression of increase," he writes.  This involves not only giving more in use value than one takes in cash value, but also radiating a positive, confident demeanor.  He highlights the significance of avoiding boastfulness, which suggests underlying doubt.  True faith, he explains, manifests as quiet assurance, drawing people towards one's success.

## XIII. The Advancing Man and the Avoidance of Domination

Wattles defines the "Advancing Man" as someone who embodies the principles of the science of getting rich, radiating confidence and progress in all endeavors. This applies across various professions, from medicine and religion to teaching and business.  However, he strongly cautions against the temptation to seek power over others, emphasizing that true success comes not from domination, but from collaboration and mutual benefit.   He warns against the "insidious temptation to seek for power over other men," stating that the desire for mastery is a competitive, not creative, mindset.  "What I want for myself, I want for everybody," he quotes Jones as saying, summarizing the creative approach.

## XIV. Overcoming Obstacles and Maintaining Faith

The author addresses potential challenges and setbacks, emphasizing that unwavering faith and gratitude are key to overcoming obstacles.  He assures that seeming failures are often stepping stones to greater opportunities, urging perseverance even when things don't go as planned. He emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive outlook and avoiding discouraging language.   The text assures the reader that no circumstance can truly defeat someone who is diligently following the principles outlined.  Even perceived failures, he emphasizes, lead to greater things: "When you make a failure, it is because you have not asked for enough; keep on, and a larger thing than you were seeking will certainly come to you."

## XV.  The Final Summary and Call to Action

The book culminates in a comprehensive summary of the principles.  The key takeaways are the power of thought and gratitude to connect with the Formless Substance, the necessity of a clear vision and unwavering faith, the importance of efficient daily action, and the imperative to project an impression of increase and advancement.  The reader is encouraged to make the science of getting rich a constant focus, to dedicate leisure time to contemplation and gratitude, and to maintain complete faith in the system's efficacy.  The final message is one of empowerment, urging readers to take action and embrace the opportunity to create their own abundant future.
