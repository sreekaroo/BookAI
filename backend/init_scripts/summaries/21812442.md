# The Best of the World's Classics, Vol. VIII: A Summary

This volume, edited by Henry Cabot Lodge and Francis W. Halsey, presents a chronological selection of prose works from Continental Europe and other regions, spanning several centuries.  The selections showcase the diverse styles and themes of notable authors, offering insights into their perspectives and the historical contexts in which they wrote.


## The Tyranny of the American Majority (Alexis de Tocqueville)

Tocqueville, having observed American democracy firsthand, expresses concern not about its weakness, but its overwhelming power. He argues against the notion that the majority always acts justly, stating,  "I hold it to be an impious and execrable maxim that, politically speaking, the people has a right to do whatever it pleases." He emphasizes the need for checks and balances, fearing the unchecked strength of the majority could lead to tyranny.  He notes the lack of effective recourse for those wronged by the majority, as all branches of government ultimately derive their authority from it.  Tocqueville suggests that a truly free democracy requires an independent judiciary and executive to mitigate the potential for tyranny.


## The Dissipated Son of Titian (Alfred de Musset)

De Musset's story follows Pomponio, Titian's son, a dissipated youth who squanders his inheritance.  The narrative opens with Pomponio emerging at dawn from a night of gambling and revelry, lamenting his losses:  "By Bacchus! my carnival has cost me dear."  The story contrasts his careless lifestyle with the beauty of Venice and the destruction caused by a recent fire, highlighting Pomponio's lack of concern for anything beyond his immediate pleasures and gambling debts.  A mysterious encounter with a negress who gifts him money and admonishes him to be more careful further emphasizes his reckless nature and the precariousness of his situation.


## Pharaoh's Triumphant Entry (Théophile Gautier)

Gautier vividly describes the Pharaoh's grand entrance into Thebes, showcasing the opulence and power of the ancient Egyptian empire. The scene is set with meticulous detail, emphasizing the scale and spectacle of the event: "Terraces, one above the other...formed a frame _en relief_ for the gigantic parallelogram."  The description moves from the roaring approach of the army, to the diverse groups within the procession—musicians, chained barbarian captives, royal princes, cavalry, and infantry.  Gautier emphasizes the Pharaoh's impassive majesty, contrasting his serene demeanor with the suffering of the captives and the ferocity of the army. The passage illustrates Gautier’s characteristically Romantic focus on vibrant imagery and sensory details.


## Yonville and Its Inhabitants (Gustave Flaubert)

Flaubert meticulously depicts the small, unremarkable Norman town of Yonville-l'Abbaye in *Madame Bovary*. The detailed descriptions of the town's architecture, businesses, and inhabitants establish a realistic and somewhat bleak setting. Flaubert uses precise language to paint a picture of provincial life, noting the town's stagnant nature and the limited opportunities for its residents.  The description of Homais, the chemist, who represents provincial pretension and self-importance, is particularly insightful. The passage exemplifies Flaubert's realist style, emphasizing the mundane and ordinary aspects of life.


## The Roman Empire's Vigorous Youth (Joseph Ernest Renan)

Renan analyzes the Roman Empire during the period of the Caesars, highlighting the contrast between the surface corruption and underlying strength of the empire. He describes the moral decay of the Roman aristocracy, but also points to the existence of noble characters and families who maintained high standards of virtue.  He contrasts the instability at the heart of the empire with the relative stability and prosperity of the provinces. Renan argues that the empire, while morally flawed, was a comparatively better system of government than its predecessors, providing a period of unprecedented peace and relative freedom, despite the potential for tyranny from its emperors.


## Thackeray's Satirical Vision (Hippolyte Adolphe Taine)

Taine contrasts the satirical styles of Dickens and Thackeray, characterizing Thackeray as a more controlled and intellectually rigorous satirist. He analyzes Thackeray's personality and its reflection in his work, noting the duality in his abilities:  "the beautiful and the ugly, force and weakness, success and failure." Taine argues against reducing human beings solely to their moral qualities, instead emphasizing the importance of understanding the underlying psychological mechanisms that drive behavior. He criticizes English literature for its focus on morality over psychology, a reflection of the nation's practical, religious, and Puritanical cultural values.


## The King's Elaborate Morning Routine (Hippolyte Adolphe Taine)

Taine’s description of the French king's morning ritual satirizes the elaborate formality and pomp of the ancient régime. The king's getting dressed becomes a meticulously staged performance, with multiple "entrées" of courtiers and officials observing every step of the process. The detailed description highlights the waste of time and resources involved in this elaborate display, emphasizing the inefficiencies and artificiality of aristocratic life.  The passage underscores Taine's broader critique of the ancien régime's societal structures and their impact on individuals.


## Napoleon III in Wartime (Emile Zola)

Zola's account portrays Napoleon III as a frail and uncertain figure during the Franco-Prussian War.  The description of the Emperor’s physical condition during the battle of Baybel, afflicted with diarrhea, is contrasted with the descriptions of his emotional anxieties about the unfolding war and the suffering of his troops. The Emperor is presented as being surrounded by incompetent advisors and utterly unaware of the precariousness of the military situation. Zola’s realistic depiction underscores the human cost of war and the devastating consequences of political miscalculation and military defeat.


##  The Widow of a Great Man (Alphonse Daudet)

Daudet’s story examines the complexities of love, fame, and the dynamics of power within a marriage.  It centers on the widow of a celebrated musician who remarries a much less famous composer. The narrative focuses on the widow's deft manipulation of her second husband, maintaining her social standing through the legacy of her deceased husband. The widow skillfully uses the great man’s memory to maintain her own elevated social position, illustrating the paradoxical nature of fame and the complicated relationship between personal life and public image.


## The End of Madame Jeanne (Guy de Maupassant)

De Maupassant’s poignant final chapter in "A Life" portrays Madame Jeanne's declining health and her fading memories.  The narrative centers on her simple routine and her longing for the past, symbolized by her repetitive tracing of her son's name in the air.  The story culminates with an emotional visit to her childhood home, where she is overwhelmed by memories and the realization of her lost youth. The evocative description of her final visit to the house, coupled with the imagery of her son’s height marks on the doorpost, underscores the passage of time and the fragility of memory.


## Luther's Wisdom and Sayings (Martin Luther)

This section offers a glimpse into Luther's personality and beliefs through his table talk and sayings. The excerpts reveal his views on a range of topics, including his views on witchcraft, marriage, education, and the nature of nobility.  Quotes like, "A marriage without children is the world without the sun," and his assessment of women as "a frail vessel," demonstrate his traditional views on family life.  His comments on scripture translation and scholastic theology highlight his efforts to make religious knowledge more accessible.


## Lessing's Comparison of Poetry and Painting (Gotthold Ephraim Lessing)

Lessing's "Laocoön" explores the distinct capabilities of poetry and painting.  He critiques the simplistic equivalence often drawn between the two art forms, rejecting the notion that one art form can simply replicate the other.  He uses Laocoön as a case study, contrasting Virgil’s description of Laocoön's agonizing cries with the restrained depiction of suffering in classical sculpture.  Lessing emphasizes the importance of understanding the unique strengths and limitations of each medium and argues that a true appreciation of art requires an understanding of its inherent nature.


## Goethe's Encounter with Shakespeare (Johann Wolfgang von Goethe)

This excerpt from *Wilhelm Meister* recounts Wilhelm's first experience reading Shakespeare. The passage showcases the transformative power of literature and the profound impact of Shakespeare's works on Wilhelm's worldview.  Wilhelm's initial reservations about Shakespeare give way to overwhelming enthusiasm after reading the plays, noting how Shakespeare’s characters feel both “natural” and yet superhuman, allowing the reader to see into their inner lives in a way no other author has.  The passage highlights the importance of self-discovery and the search for genuine understanding in the world.


## Schiller's Account of the Battle of Lützen (Friedrich von Schiller)

Schiller’s historical account depicts the Battle of Lützen (1632) and the death of King Gustavus Adolphus. The detailed description of the battle's ebb and flow, punctuated by the contrasting bravery of King Gustavus Adolphus and General Pappenheim, emphasizes the chaos and brutality of war.  The death of Gustavus Adolphus, initially causing dismay, ultimately serves to galvanize the Swedish troops to victory. Schiller’s narrative style balances historical detail with dramatic tension, highlighting the bravery and sacrifice of the soldiers on both sides.


## Philip II and the Netherlands (Friedrich von Schiller)

Schiller's introduction to his *History of the Revolt of the Netherlands* frames the struggle for Dutch independence as a significant moment in the fight for human liberty. He emphasizes the unexpected success of the Dutch rebellion against the powerful Spanish Empire, underlining the power of perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds. Schiller highlights the courage and resilience of the Dutch people, contrasting their peaceful nature with their fierce resistance to oppression under Philip II.


## Schlegel's Analysis of Macbeth (August Wilhelm von Schlegel)

Schlegel analyzes Shakespeare's *Macbeth*, focusing on the role of the witches and the play's exploration of ambition and guilt. He criticizes attempts to "improve" Shakespeare's work, arguing that the play's power lies in its depiction of both supernatural forces and human psychology.  Schlegel emphasizes the play’s dramatic intensity, highlighting scenes like Duncan's murder and Lady Macbeth's descent into madness. He analyzes the play’s exploration of guilt and ambition, noting that while Macbeth commits terrible acts, he also retains some of his heroic qualities.


## Humboldt's Essay on Man (Alexander von Humboldt)

Humboldt's essay, drawn from *Cosmos*, provides a broad overview of humankind's relationship with nature and the challenges of classifying human races. He argues for the unity of the human race despite phenotypic variations, citing evidence from physical anthropology and linguistics.  Humboldt cautions against simplistic racial classifications, emphasizing the complexities of human history, migration, and cultural exchange. His essay highlights the interconnectedness of the physical and intellectual worlds and the need for careful observation and interdisciplinary study.


## Heine's Reminiscences of Napoleon (Heinrich Heine)

Heine's evocative account combines personal memories with reflections on Napoleon's legacy.  The description of Heine's childhood encounters with Napoleon’s image and later seeing Napoleon in person, contrasts the grandeur of the Emperor with the everyday realities of life. Heine then contrasts the Emperor’s seemingly serene demeanor with the brutality of the Napoleonic wars.  Heine’s narrative shifts between personal feelings and historical analysis, creating a memorable and insightful portrait of both the Emperor and the author's own evolving understanding of history and human nature.


## Erasmus's Wit and Wisdom (Desiderius Erasmus)

This selection presents a series of excerpts from Erasmus’s writings, showcasing his wit, wisdom, and criticisms of the Catholic Church and its abuses.  Erasmus offers insightful observations on human nature and political life, using vivid imagery and aphorisms to convey his message. He critiques the Church's emphasis on ritual over genuine faith, and denounces corruption within the Church.  The excerpts demonstrate Erasmus's sharp intellect, his elegant style, and his efforts to promote reform while avoiding revolution.


## Cervantes' Don Quixote (Miguel de Cervantes)

This selection contains two excerpts from *Don Quixote*: the first depicting the beginnings of Quixote's career as a knight-errant, and the second his death.  The first excerpt shows Quixote's obsession with books of chivalry, which leads him to abandon his normal life and embark on his quixotic adventures.  Cervantes employs satire to contrast Quixote's delusion with the reality of his world. The second excerpt focuses on Quixote's return to sanity before his death.  He makes a final condemnation of books of chivalry before peacefully passing away. These excerpts exemplify Cervantes' masterful use of satire, humor, and pathos.


## Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes (Hans Christian Andersen)

Andersen’s fairy tale satirizes vanity, conformity, and the abuse of power. The story of the emperor and the swindlers who convince him that they can weave invisible clothes, reveals how easily people can be swayed by authority and social pressure to accept falsehoods. The child's innocent observation that the emperor is naked exposes the foolishness of the adults and their willingness to ignore reality for the sake of appearing wise or compliant. The story's simple plot and moral lesson have made it a classic of children’s literature, as well as insightful social commentary.


## Bazarov's Death (Ivan Turgenev)

This excerpt from *Fathers and Children* depicts Bazarov's death. The passage contrasts the dramatic arrival of Madame Odintsov, who brings a doctor, with Bazarov’s acceptance of his own mortality. Bazarov’s final moments are imbued with a mixture of regret, defiance, and acceptance. His interaction with Anna Sergyevna reveals both his cynical worldview and his unexpected capacity for love and tenderness. The concluding scene, showing Bazarov's death and his father's subsequent despair, leaves the reader with a sense of profound loss and the complex emotions surrounding death and its implications.


## Ibsen's Thought Child (Henrik Ibsen)

Ibsen's excerpt from *The Pretenders* explores the theme of ambition and the dilemma faced by King Skule. King Skule’s conversation with Jatgeir the Skald reveals his desperate desire for a loyal follower—a “son” who would completely sacrifice himself to Skule’s ambition.  The Skald’s refusal to abandon his identity as a poet underscores the limitations of subservience, and the necessity to retain one's own sense of purpose and identity. The dramatic arrival of news about Hakon’s approaching fleet highlights the urgency and high stakes of Skule’s political struggles.
