# 30,000 Locked Out: A Summary

This summary chronicles the events of the 1887 Chicago building trades strike and lockout, focusing on the conflict between employers and the Bricklayers' Union, and the broader implications for labor relations.

## The National Association of Builders Convenes

In March 1887, the National Association of Builders convened in Chicago, bringing together delegates from 27 cities across the United States.  Their stated purpose, as outlined in Article II of their constitution, was to "foster and protect the interests of contractors, manual workmen, and all others concerned in the erection and construction of buildings."  Crucially, they adopted a "Declaration of Principles" emphasizing "absolute personal independence of the individual to work or not to work, to employ or not to employ," a principle they considered fundamental but often violated in practice by labor organizations.  The declaration also acknowledged the potential for good in workers' associations, advocating for a system of "payment 'by the hour'" and uniformity in contracts and lien laws.  This seemingly balanced approach, however, would not prevent the impending conflict.

## The Bricklayers' Unreasonable Demands

The immediate trigger for the lockout was a resolution passed by the United Order of American Bricklayers and Stonemasons of Chicago on April 11th, mandating Saturday paydays.  This was presented as a fait accompli, without prior consultation with the Master Masons' association. This action was not an isolated incident but part of a pattern of increasingly demanding and often arbitrary actions by the union, dating back to a nine-week strike in 1883. The 1883 strike, settled through arbitration, was ultimately repudiated by the union, showcasing their disregard for agreed-upon compromises.  Subsequent years saw a series of demands, including reduced hours, increased wages, restrictions on apprentices, and the establishment of a powerful "Walking Delegate" wielding significant influence over contractors.  The "Declaration of Principles" adopted by the builders earlier seemed directly challenged by the actions of the Bricklayers.

## The Carpenters' Strike

The 1887 conflict began with a carpenters' strike in early April, demanding an eight-hour workday and 35 cents per hour.  The strike was initiated without consultation with the Master Carpenters, demonstrating a similar disregard for employer input as seen in the bricklayers' actions. The carpenters' ultimatum, demanding recognition of their union, proved a stumbling block for employers. Despite the Master Carpenters' counter-offer of eight hours and 30 cents per hour, the union remained steadfast. The strike eventually collapsed after two weeks due to internal divisions and fatigue, highlighting the inherent instability of strikes based on inflexible demands and a lack of internal cohesion.

## The Formation of the Amalgamated Council of Building Trades

Faced with individual union strikes, employers recognized the need for a united front.  The carpenters' strike spurred collaboration among several trades in the formation of the Amalgamated Council of the Building Trades of Chicago in April.  This council aimed to coordinate actions and exert more pressure on contractors. The Amalgamated Council consolidated the power of several trades, showing the escalating conflict. The council’s declaration of principles and rules gave evidence that the employers would have to fight the unions as a united body.


## The Master Masons' Response and the Lockout

The increasingly bold and uncompromising demands from various unions, particularly the bricklayers' Saturday payday mandate, led the Master Masons' association to take a firm stance. Recognizing the pattern of arbitrary union actions, they unanimously decided to resist, anticipating and preparing for a general strike. Their strategy involved not conceding to unreasonable demands and securing the support of building material suppliers, who agreed to halt deliveries pending a settlement. The strategy of the Master Masons was to resist until the union conceded to reasonable demands.

## The Expanding Strike and the Material Suppliers' Support

The bricklayers' strike on May 11th, stemming from the Saturday payday issue, expanded rapidly.  Two thousand bricklayers walked out, followed by other trades, totaling 15,000 idle workers by May 13th.  Crucially, brick and stone manufacturers joined the Master Masons, refusing to supply materials, effectively crippling construction. This widespread support for the Master Masons significantly strengthened their position. The material providers’ action brought an end to further strikes.

## A Platform of Principles and the Brick Yards Shut Down

The Builders' and Traders' Exchange convened a mass meeting, issuing a strong statement against union interference with individual liberty and endorsing the Master Masons' stance.  They declared that "absolute personal independence of the individual...is a fundamental principle." This united front included architects and the Real Estate Board, signifying the widespread concern about the unions' methods. The brick yards' closure further solidified the Master Masons’ position.

##  The Conference of Building Trades and a Modified Platform

A Conference of Building Trades was held, and a platform of principles was adopted, emphasizing individual liberty for both employers and employees.  This platform ultimately removed the clause requiring employees to sign the agreement, replacing it with a requirement to assent to the principles. This amendment demonstrated a willingness to find common ground while still holding the line against union overreach.

## Negotiations and the Collapse of the Strike

Efforts were made to negotiate, including a proposal for arbitration.  However, the Bricklayers' Union initially proved inflexible.  Their ultimate capitulation, withdrawing their demand for Saturday paydays and declaring the strike off, stemmed from internal pressure and financial difficulties. The Bricklayers' action ended the strike and lead to negotiations between the two parties.

## Arbitration and a Lasting Settlement

A joint arbitration committee, including a neutral umpire, was established. After extensive negotiations, the committee issued an award that addressed various points of contention, including working hours, wages, and apprentice ratios. The award notably eliminated the "Walking Delegate," a key source of conflict.  The final settlement created a mechanism for future dispute resolution via a joint standing arbitration committee, establishing a precedent for collaborative labor relations.  The resolution underscored the importance of arbitration as a means of preventing future conflicts and setting a framework for mutually beneficial labor practices.
