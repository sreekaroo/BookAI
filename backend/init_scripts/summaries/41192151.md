# The Principles of Scientific Management: A Summary

## 1.  National Efficiency and the Need for Systematic Management

Frederick Winslow Taylor's *The Principles of Scientific Management* opens by addressing the urgent need for increased national efficiency, echoing President Roosevelt's call for conservation of national resources.  Taylor argues that while material waste is readily apparent, the "larger wastes of human effort" are less visible but equally significant. He highlights the pervasive inefficiency stemming from "blundering, ill-directed, or inefficient" actions, a problem he believes is far greater than the depletion of natural resources.  The solution, according to Taylor, lies not in searching for exceptional individuals but in implementing systematic management.  He introduces a shift in paradigm: "In the past the man has been first; in the future the system must be first."

## 2.  The Goal of Maximum Prosperity for Both Employer and Employee

Taylor establishes the core principle of scientific management: achieving "maximum prosperity for the employer, coupled with the maximum prosperity for each employee."  This is not merely about maximizing profits and wages; it encompasses the development of the business to its "highest state of excellence" and the development of each employee to their "state of maximum efficiency." He challenges the prevailing belief that employer and employee interests are inherently antagonistic, asserting that "the true interests of the two are one and the same."  He uses the example of shoemaking to illustrate how increased efficiency (making more shoes) allows for both higher wages and greater profits.


## 3.  The Scourge of "Soldiering" and its Underlying Causes

Taylor identifies "soldiering" (deliberate underworking) as a significant impediment to national and individual prosperity. He attributes this pervasive phenomenon to three main causes: the false belief that increased output leads to job losses; defective management systems that incentivize slow work to protect workers' interests; and inefficient rule-of-thumb methods that waste effort. He quotes from his previous work, "Shop Management," to elaborate on the concept of "systematic soldiering," where workers deliberately restrict output to prevent piece-rate cuts or to avoid exceeding established norms: "'Why should I work hard when that lazy fellow gets the same pay that I do and does only half as much work?'"

## 4.  Replacing Rule-of-Thumb with Scientific Methods

Taylor emphasizes the vast potential for increased efficiency through the replacement of rule-of-thumb methods with scientific ones.  He notes the existence of numerous inefficient ways to perform even the simplest tasks, often varying by 50 or 100 different approaches within the same trade.  He asserts that a scientific study is needed to identify the "one best method," a process involving "accurate, minute, motion and time study."  He contrasts this approach with the old systems where workmen bear almost total responsibility, arguing that in most cases, workmen lack the scientific knowledge or mental capacity to optimize their work without guidance.

## 5.  The Science of Handling Pig Iron: A Case Study

Taylor details the scientific management of pig-iron handling at the Bethlehem Steel Company.  This case study serves as a fundamental illustration of his principles.  He explains how, through observation and study, he determined that a first-class pig-iron handler should move 47 tons per day instead of the current 12.5 tons.  The selection of Schmidt, a "Pennsylvania Dutchman," highlights the importance of choosing workers based on their physical capabilities and suitability for the monotonous task, acknowledging this task's low mental demands. Taylor describes his direct, almost blunt, approach in motivating Schmidt, emphasizing the reward of higher wages ($1.85 instead of $1.15) and the need for obedience:  "If you are a high-priced man, you will do exactly as this man tells you tomorrow, from morning till night."


## 6.  Scientific Management's Four Key Principles

Taylor outlines the four key principles of scientific management that differentiate it from traditional methods: (1) developing a science for each element of a man's work; (2) scientifically selecting, training, and developing the workman; (3) heartily cooperating with the men to ensure work is done according to the science; and (4) an almost equal division of the work and responsibility between management and workmen.  He contrasts this with the "initiative and incentive" model where the workman bears almost sole responsibility, highlighting the shift towards shared responsibility and management's proactive role in planning and training.


## 7.  Shoveling: Another Example of Scientific Method Application

Taylor expands his argument by illustrating the science behind seemingly simple tasks like shoveling. He explains how experiments revealed the optimal shovel load for maximum output (approximately 21 pounds), leading to the standardization of shovels to match different materials.  This led to a specialized tool room and a system of instruction cards to ensure each worker used the appropriate shovel. He highlights the reduction of labor costs and increase of efficiency, citing a massive reduction in the number of laborers (from 400-600 to about 140) and a significant rise in tonnage per man per day (from 16 to 59). The total savings in one year amounted to $36,417.69.

## 8.  The Importance of Individualized Work and Task Management

Taylor emphasizes the detrimental effects of gang work, demonstrating how individual ambition is stifled when workers are grouped together, leading to a decrease in overall efficiency. He mandated a maximum of four men per gang, aiming to individualize tasks and reward individual performance.  He contrasts this with a situation in Pittsburgh, where despite higher pay, gang work resulted in lower individual earnings than the individualized, task-based system at Bethlehem.  This underscores the importance of incentivizing individual effort and providing clear, measurable tasks.  The "task idea" is pivotal, with workers receiving a substantial bonus for completing their assigned task within the set time.

## 9.  Scientific Bricklaying: Motion Study and Task Performance

The bricklaying example, through the work of Frank B. Gilbreth, further illustrates the application of scientific management. Gilbreth's motion study reduced bricklaying movements from eighteen to five, significantly boosting efficiency. This involved eliminating unnecessary motions, introducing improved tools (like adjustable scaffolds and brick "packets"), and teaching bricklayers to use both hands simultaneously.  The case study demonstrates the remarkable increase in output (from 120 to 350 bricks per hour) due to scientific analysis, standardization, and worker training, highlighting the need for management cooperation and consistent instruction.


## 10. Bicycle Ball Inspection: Scientific Selection and Task Management

The bicycle ball inspection process illustrates the significance of worker selection.  Taylor describes how Mr. Sanford E. Thompson identified the need for inspectors with quick perception ("low personal coefficient"), leading to the replacement of slower workers, regardless of their other attributes. This, coupled with over-inspection to maintain quality and the introduction of differential rate piece work (higher pay for increased output and accuracy), resulted in a drastic reduction in the workforce (from 120 to 35) while significantly improving both quantity and quality.  This shows that even in seemingly simple tasks, scientific selection of personnel is crucial for optimal results.  The importance of frequent feedback (hourly in this case) is also highlighted, as a way of maintaining motivation and ensuring task completion.


## 11.  The Science of Cutting Metals:  Intricate Laws and Slide Rules

Taylor delves into the complex science of cutting metals, emphasizing the intricate mathematical calculations required to determine optimal cutting speeds and feeds. Twelve variables influence these calculations, requiring the development of complex formulas and slide rules to simplify the process.  He explains how these scientific methods, combined with worker training and functional foremanship, enabled machinists to significantly increase their output (two and a half to nine times faster), highlighting the inadequacy of rule-of-thumb methods even for experienced machinists.

## 12. Functional Foremanship and the Transformation of Worker Attitudes

Taylor introduces the concept of functional foremanship, replacing the single foreman with eight specialized teachers or "functional foremen," each responsible for a specific aspect of the workman's job. This system ensures close cooperation and constant guidance, facilitating the efficient application of scientific knowledge and methods. The system also addresses issues like task assignment, tool maintenance, and quality control.  While initially some workers might perceive this as overly controlling ("I am not allowed to think or move without some one interfering"), Taylor argues that it leads to broader development and higher-skilled jobs, similar to the specialized training of surgeons.  He emphasizes the importance of worker suggestions and rewards for innovation.


## 13.  The Mechanism versus the Essence of Scientific Management

Taylor cautions against confusing the mechanism (time study, functional foremanship, etc.) with the essence of scientific management, which lies in its underlying principles and philosophy. He stresses the crucial importance of a supportive culture and gradual implementation to avoid resistance and conflicts.  He uses an example of a failed rapid implementation in a large establishment, highlighting the danger of using the mechanism without fully understanding and adhering to the underlying principles.  The gradual change, accompanied by proper training and the demonstration of tangible benefits to the workers, is emphasized as essential for success.

## 14.  The Benefits of Scientific Management:  Shared Prosperity and National Gain

Taylor concludes by summarizing the benefits of widespread scientific management adoption, emphasizing its potential to double the average worker's productivity. This, he argues, will significantly improve overall national prosperity, allowing for shorter working hours and increased opportunities for education and recreation.  He stresses the harmonious cooperation and improved worker morale as key aspects of the system.  He emphasizes that the benefits are shared by the workers, employers, and the public through lower prices and enhanced productivity, dispelling the fear that increased productivity would lead to unemployment.  Taylor highlights the system's success in promoting fairness and justice through scientific investigation and cooperation.
