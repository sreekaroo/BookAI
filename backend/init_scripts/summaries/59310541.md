# Leonardo da Vinci: A Life and Treatise on Painting - A Chronological Summary

## Early Life and Artistic Beginnings (1452-1489)

Leonardo da Vinci, born in 1452 as the illegitimate son of a notary, displayed early artistic talent. His father, recognizing his son's aptitude, sought the opinion of Andrea Verocchio, a renowned Florentine artist. Verocchio's positive assessment led to Leonardo's apprenticeship under him.  During this period, Leonardo excelled, surpassing his master in skill, most notably evidenced by his contribution to Verocchio's painting of *The Baptism of Christ*.  Verocchio's subsequent abandonment of painting due to Leonardo's superior ability highlights the young artist's exceptional promise:  "Leonardo succeeded so well, that, despairing of ever equalling the work of his scholar, Verocchio in disgust abandoned his pencil for ever, confining himself in future solely to the practice of sculpture."  This marked the beginning of Leonardo's independent artistic journey. He produced various works during this period, including a cartoon of *Adam and Eve* and a unique shield depicting a terrifying composite beast.


## Milan and the Sforza Court (1489-1499)

Around 1489, Leonardo's reputation reached Lodovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, who offered him a substantial pension. The Duke's interest was primarily in Leonardo's engineering skills, as evidenced by Leonardo's own proposal, a self-described "memorial":  "He offers to make for the Duke military bridges, which should be at the same time light and very solid, and to teach him the method of placing and defending them with security." While engineering was a priority, Leonardo also undertook painting commissions. His masterpiece from this period, *The Last Supper*, remains iconic despite significant damage caused by improper wall preparation and later modifications.  The anecdote about the Duke's impatience and Leonardo's clever response regarding the likeness of Judas to the complaining Prior illustrates the artist's both dedication and wit.


##  The Martesana Canal Project and Scientific Pursuits (1490s)

In the 1490s, Leonardo took on the ambitious task of overseeing the construction of the Martesana Canal, a project that required significant engineering expertise and knowledge of various scientific fields.  He worked extensively at the home of his friend Signior Melzi, applying himself to "the study of philosophy, mathematics, and every branch of science that could at all further his design". During this time, he likely produced a substantial portion of his extensive manuscript collections. These volumes, written backward, showcase a mind deeply engaged in multifaceted pursuits and are described as "occasional notes, the Author always intending afterwards to compose from them complete treatises."


## Return to Florence and Portraiture (1499-1507)

The political instability in Lombardy, following the downfall of the Sforza dynasty, prompted Leonardo's return to Florence.  Here, his focus shifted to portraiture and he produced *Mona Lisa*, also known as *La Gioconda*, a work that took four years to complete and remains a testament to his innovative techniques. This work, while considered unfinished by Leonardo himself due to his ever-evolving standards ("his own most laboured pieces were far from being finished to that extent of beauty which he wished to give them"), it has achieved the status of a masterpiece, celebrated for its lifelike qualities.  He also painted portraits of a Mantuan nobleman and Ginevra Benci.


##  The Battle of Anghiari Cartoon and Rivalry with Michelangelo (1503-1508)

In 1503, Leonardo was commissioned to paint the Battle of Anghiari in Florence's council chamber. This undertaking brought him into direct competition with Michelangelo, marking the beginning of a long-lasting rivalry.  The project, however, suffered setbacks due to Leonardo's experimentations with new techniques, resulting in his colors peeling from the wall ("he found his colours peel from the wall").   The competition and contrasting styles of the two masters spurred both artistic innovation and intense rivalry.


## Rome and Disappointment (1513-1516)

Leonardo’s move to Rome in 1513, fueled by the hopes of employment from Pope Leo X, proved disappointing. The Pope's lack of understanding of Leonardo's meticulous approach and preparation for painting caused a rift, preventing the realization of any significant commissions.  The Pope’s dismissive remark, "that he could expect nothing from a man who thought of finishing his works before he had begun them," aptly summarizes the conflict between Leonardo's artistic vision and the Pope's limited perspective.


##  France and the Patronage of Francis I (1516-1519)

Disillusioned by his Roman experience, Leonardo accepted the invitation of King Francis I of France. His arrival in France marked the end of his major artistic output, hampered by age and declining health.  Despite this physical decline, he was warmly welcomed by the King, even though any expectations of further artistic commissions proved fruitless. The account of Leonardo's death in King Francis's arms, however historically debated, highlights the affection and respect held by the King towards this aging genius.


## Leonardo's Writings: A Legacy of Scientific and Artistic Insight

Leonardo's immense body of work extends beyond his paintings. His fourteen manuscript volumes in Paris, supplemented by a fifteenth volume in the British Royal Collection, offer detailed insights into his scientific and artistic thought. Venturi's description of these collections as “first sketches and occasional notes” underlines their nature as working documents rather than polished treatises:  "They contain speculations in those branches of natural philosophy nearest allied to geometry; that they are first sketches and occasional notes, the Author always intending afterwards to compose from them complete treatises."  This reflects Leonardo’s ceaseless intellectual curiosity and his continuous process of experimentation and observation.


## The Treatise on Painting: A Compilation of Leonardo's Insights

The *Treatise on Painting* emerged from these manuscript collections, compiled and edited posthumously. The preface to Rigaud's translation emphasizes the lack of systematic organization in the original, highlighting the current edition's contribution in "placing each chapter under the proper head or branch of the art". The compilation’s structure, reflecting the haphazard nature of Leonardo’s original notes, leads to some repetition, yet underscores the consistency of his principles.  The editor’s emphasis on fidelity and precision, in contrast to previous translations, reflects the respect for Leonardo’s thought.


##  The Treatise's Focus:  Bridging Theory and Practice

The *Treatise on Painting* is not a mere collection of artistic techniques but a testament to Leonardo's scientific approach to art.  He repeatedly emphasizes the importance of a solid theoretical foundation based on observation of nature:  "Practice must always be founded on good theory; to this, Perspective is the guide and entrance, without which nothing can be well done."  The treatise covers various aspects of art, including drawing, proportion, anatomy, motion, perspective (linear and aerial), composition, expression, light and shadow, color, and the use of reflexes. Each chapter contains detailed instructions, observations, and insightful anecdotes—underlining his concept of  'universality' in mastering art.  Many chapters include references to other, unpublished treatises, revealing his ambitious plans for more systematic expositions of his knowledge.  The book serves as a guide for aspiring artists, urging them to study from life, grasp the underlying principles, and create works that are both technically sound and emotionally engaging.
