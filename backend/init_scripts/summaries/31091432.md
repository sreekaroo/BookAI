### **I. The Genesis of a Book: Royal Palaces and Parks of France**

The preface establishes the book's unique approach to French royal history.  Instead of focusing solely on political events, it explores the rich tapestry of historical and romantic incidents associated with royal palaces and parks.  The authors, Francis Miltoun and Blanche McManus, aim to showcase the often-overlooked aspects of French royal life that unfolded outside the formal confines of official records. A quote from the preface illustrates this:  "A thousand years ago, by the rim of a tiny spring, a monk...knelt down to say a prayer...After the monk came a king, the latter to hunt in the neighbouring forest."  This anecdote sets the stage for a narrative that weaves together legend, historical accounts, and personal anecdotes to create a vibrant portrait of French royalty's relationship with their surroundings.  The book also acknowledges a geographical limitation, focusing primarily on the palaces and parks surrounding Paris, and those in regions already detailed in the authors’ other collaborative works.
