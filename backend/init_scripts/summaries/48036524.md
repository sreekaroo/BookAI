## Vitruvius' Ten Books on Architecture: A Summary

### Preface: Dedication and Justification

Vitruvius dedicates his treatise, *The Ten Books on Architecture*, to the Emperor Caesar, explaining his delay in publication due to the Emperor's busy schedule managing the vast Roman empire. He highlights his past service to the Emperor's father and the Emperor himself, particularly in the construction and repair of military machinery, emphasizing his gratitude for the Emperor's patronage. Vitruvius asserts that the treatise offers definite rules to assess both existing and future buildings, claiming to unveil all the art's principles within its pages.  He anticipates potential criticism regarding his writing style, admitting to focusing more on the art's efficacy than on eloquent rhetoric.  His concluding statement,  "But as regards the efficacy of the art and the theories of it, I promise and expect that in these volumes I shall undoubtedly show myself of very considerable importance not only to builders but also to all scholars," encapsulates his ambition for the work.

### Book I: The Architect's Education and Urban Planning

Book I establishes the foundation for architectural practice.  Vitruvius stresses the importance of both practical experience ("Practice is the continuous and regular exercise of employment where manual work is done with any necessary material according to the design of a drawing") and theoretical knowledge ("Theory, on the other hand, is the ability to demonstrate and explain the productions of dexterity on the principles of proportion").  He emphasizes a broad education encompassing various disciplines such as drawing, geometry, history, philosophy, music, medicine, law, and astronomy, providing examples illustrating the importance of historical knowledge in understanding architectural design elements (e.g., the origin of Caryatides). He concludes that architecture requires multifaceted learning but acknowledges the impossibility of absolute mastery in every field.

### Book I (Continued): Fundamental Principles of Architecture

Vitruvius outlines six essential principles that govern architecture: Order, Arrangement, Eurythmy, Symmetry, Propriety, and Economy.  He elaborates on each, defining Order as the "due measure to the members of a work considered separately, and symmetrical agreement to the proportions of the whole,"  Arrangement encompassing ground plans, elevations, and perspective, and Eurythmy relating to the harmonious proportions of a building's elements. Symmetry, he explains, involves "a proper agreement between the members of the work itself, and relation between the different parts and the whole general scheme, in accordance with a certain part selected as standard." Propriety addresses stylistic appropriateness based on function and tradition (e.g., Doric for masculine deities, Corinthian for feminine), while Economy encompasses resourcefulness in material selection and cost management.

### Book II: Building Materials and Their Properties

This book delves into the characteristics of various building materials.  Vitruvius explores the properties of bricks (emphasizing the need for adequate drying time), sand (comparing pit sand, river sand, and sea sand), and lime (highlighting its role in binding materials). He gives a detailed explanation of pozzolana, a volcanic ash, and its unique ability to harden underwater, attributing this to its volcanic origins and its reaction with water and lime.  He also meticulously examines different types of stone, contrasting soft stones easily worked but susceptible to weathering with harder, more durable varieties. His analysis demonstrates an understanding of the elemental composition of materials and their effect on structural properties.

### Book III: Temple Design and the Ionic Order

Book III focuses on the design of temples.  Vitruvius begins by establishing the connection between the proportions of the human body and those of buildings ("For the human body is so designed by nature that..."), arguing that ideal structures should exhibit similar harmonious ratios.  He then classifies temples based on the arrangement of columns (e.g., in antis, prostyle, peripteral, dipteral) and intercolumniations (pycnostyle, systyle, diastyle, araeostyle, eustyle), providing detailed explanations and examples of each type. The book meticulously details the proportions of the Ionic order, specifying the dimensions of bases, columns, capitals (including volutes), and entablature elements.  He addresses issues of optical correction, such as the slight increase in column thickness towards the middle ([Greek: entasis]) and the inclination of entablature elements to counter visual distortions.

### Book IV: Temple Design: Doric and Corinthian Orders

Book IV continues the discussion of temple design, exploring the Doric and Corinthian orders. While noting the challenges posed by the arrangement of triglyphs and metopes in Doric temples, he details the order's proportions, emphasizing the importance of maintaining consistent ratios. Vitruvius presents the legend surrounding the origin of the Corinthian capital, connecting it to the aesthetic of feminine grace. He offers precise dimensions for Corinthian capitals, columns, and entablatures, emphasizing the variability of these elements based on the overall scale of the building.  He contrasts the Doric and Corinthian orders with the Ionic, highlighting their distinct features and characteristics.

### Book V: Public Buildings: Forums, Basilicas, and Theatres

Book V shifts the focus to public buildings. Vitruvius describes the layout and design of forums and basilicas, paying particular attention to their functionality and integration with the surrounding urban space. He then provides a thorough account of theatre design, beginning with the crucial selection of a healthy and acoustically suitable site.  He provides a detailed explanation of the theatre’s plan, including the arrangement of seating, stage, and backstage areas. He contrasts Roman theatre plans (based on equilateral triangles) with Greek ones (based on squares), further emphasizing the incorporation of acoustic principles through the use of resonating bronze vessels ([Greek: echeia]) strategically placed within the theatre to amplify sound.

### Book VI: Private Dwellings and Their Proportions

Book VI addresses private dwellings, emphasizing the influence of climate on house design.  Vitruvius advocates for adapting the house plan to suit local conditions, noting the differences in building styles across various regions, citing variations in human physique and temperament as evidence of the impact of climate. He meticulously presents the different types of atria (Tuscan, Corinthian, tetrastyle, displuviate, and testudinate), specifying their proportions and spatial arrangements. The book outlines the proper arrangement and dimensions of various rooms (e.g., tablinum, alae, peristyle, dining rooms, bedrooms) and the importance of their orientation to maximize sunlight and ventilation.


### Book VII: Construction Techniques and Decorative Finishes

Book VII details construction techniques and decorative finishes.  Vitruvius describes the process of floor construction (from preparing the subfloor to laying the finished surface), emphasizing the importance of using appropriate materials and techniques to ensure durability.  He focuses on the preparation and application of stucco, providing specific instructions for the slaking of lime, the layering of mortar, and the use of various pigments.  He laments the decline in quality of fresco painting, criticizing the prevalence of unrealistic and fantastical imagery, advocating for a return to depictions of reality.  He extensively covers the preparation and application of various colours, both natural and artificial, concluding with a discussion of the different ways to achieve durable and aesthetically pleasing finishes.

### Book VIII and IX: Water Supply and Astronomy’s Role in Architecture

Book VIII deals with the crucial element of water. He details methods for locating underground water sources, highlighting different indicators and tests. He then examines various types of water, discussing their properties, including their taste, smell, temperature, and medicinal qualities, relating their characteristics to the surrounding geological formations.  The book also covers techniques for conducting water, comparing the use of channels, conduits, and pipes made of lead or clay (emphasizing the dangers of lead).  Book IX surprisingly shifts to astronomy. Vitruvius explores the celestial sphere, the constellations, and the movements of the planets, explaining how these celestial movements determine the length of days and nights and the changes in seasons. This knowledge is essential for creating accurate sundials and water clocks, which are meticulously described, highlighting their complex mechanisms.

### Book X:  Machines and Military Engineering

The final book concludes the treatise with a detailed discussion of machines, beginning with their general definition and categorization (climbing, pneumatic, and hoisting machines). Vitruvius then proceeds to explain the principles of hoisting machines, including the use of ropes, pulleys, and windlasses.  He meticulously outlines the construction of various machines (including those for raising water), providing detailed instructions on their mechanisms and proportions. The book extends this to military applications, discussing siege engines like the battering ram, tortoises, and catapults, along with detailed specifications for their construction and operation.  This section ends by emphasizing that skillful planning is just as important as the machines themselves in achieving military success. Vitruvius concludes by reflecting on the significance of his work, summarizing the principles discussed in each of the ten books.
