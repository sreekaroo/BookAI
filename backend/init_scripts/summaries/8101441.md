## A Summary of Désiré Charnay's "Cités et Ruines Américaines"

**1.  The Enigma of American Antiquities:** The preface introduces the book's central theme: the exploration and documentation of pre-Columbian ruins in Mexico and the Yucatán Peninsula.  Charnay, overwhelmed by the scope of the project, sought the expertise of Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc to analyze the architectural significance of these sites. Viollet-le-Duc notes the scholarly debate surrounding the origins of these civilizations, posing questions about racial origins and influences:  "À Izamal, par exemple, vous trouvez, dans les bases des pyramides artificielles que surmontaient les temples, des figures gigantesques rappelant les sphinx de l'Égypte."  The text emphasizes the incomplete nature of previous historical accounts, often biased by Spanish colonial perspectives and the destruction of indigenous records.

**2.  The American Continent and its Diverse Peoples:** Viollet-le-Duc discusses the geography of the Americas, highlighting the mountain ranges and river systems that shaped migration patterns. He proposes that migrations from both the Bering Strait and Greenland contributed to the diverse populations of Mexico. The author cites the work of Cuvier and Flourens, acknowledging the presence of multiple racial types: "On trouve de tout en Amérique, depuis le noir du Congo jusqu'au blanc pur en passant par le touranien et la variété rouge." This diversity complicates efforts to identify a single aboriginal American race.

**3. Early American Civilizations and their Connections:** The text explores the early civilizations of the Americas, including the Olmecs, Toltecs, and Aztecs. It suggests that the Olmecs and Toltecs were sophisticated builders, far preceding the Aztec conquest.  Viollet-le-Duc points to evidence of a pre-existing phonographic writing system: "Les Américains possédaient avant les voyages de Colomb une écriture phonétique".   He also examines the historical record, mentioning the possible Norse contact and the intriguing similarities between Mayan traditions, Norse sagas, and Mesoamerican legends. The presence of features resembling Egyptian sphinxes in Izamal and Greek architectural elements in Uxmal also fuel the discussion about foreign influence.


**4. Architectural Analysis and Cultural Influences:** Viollet-le-Duc introduces his architectural analysis, emphasizing the importance of construction methods to determine racial origins.  He observes that the use of mortar is prevalent in Mesoamerican architecture, suggesting a Turanian or Finnish influence, while the absence of mortar indicates Aryan or Semitic origins. Yet, Aryan influences are evident, particularly in the use of structural elements that suggest a derivation from timber construction techniques: "Tous les monuments les plus anciens de l'Inde, bien que taillés dans le roc ou bâtis en pierre, laissent voir une tradition appartenant à la construction de bois." This highlights the complex interplay of cultural influences in the architecture.


**5. Exploring the Yucatán Ruins (Izamal):** The account details the impressive pyramids of Izamal, noting the colossal, stucco-covered head at the base of one pyramid. Viollet-le-Duc analyzes this structure, emphasizing the advanced skill required for such stucco work, which he associates with Turanian or mixed-race populations: "un peuple primitif...assemble du bois...mais il n'arrive que bien tard à mettre en oeuvre avec succès une matière comme le mortier..."  The sheer scale of the pyramids, built of solid masonry, further speaks to the sophistication of the builders.

**6. The Ruins of Chichen Itza:** The description moves to Chichen Itza, focusing on the "Prison," a less well-built structure, and the "Cirque," which features carvings of jaguars and warriors. The author highlights the relative quality of construction and the use of stucco modeling.  He points out the presence of circular holes, suggesting the use of wooden poles and porticos: "Ces trous...paraissent avoir été réservés pour recevoir des _boulins_ ou grosses perches de bois...". The interior bas-reliefs of the Cirque are analyzed, comparing the depicted human types with pre-existing examples from Mexico and suggesting a blend of northern European and indigenous traits.


**7. The Architectural Marvels of Uxmal:** The text details the vast ruins of Uxmal, using a map to orient the reader.  The author comments on the "Palace of the Nuns" and its intricate stonework, which shows clear signs of mimicking timber framing techniques.   Viollet-Le-Duc uses illustrations to show how stone structures imitate the layered, corbelled construction found in early timber structures:  "la tradition d'une structure de bois par empilage...est évidente". He also describes the "Governor's Palace," the "House of the Turtles," and the "House of the Doves," highlighting the remarkable skill and diverse stylistic influences evident in these buildings.


**8. The Ancient City of Palenqué:** The exploration moves to Palenqué, where the ruins differ significantly from those of the Yucatán.  The author notes the advanced sculptural techniques of Palenqué but a different overall artistic style: "Les édifices...ne ressemblent à ceux de la péninsule yucatèque."  The "Cross" bas-relief is specifically examined, comparing the human figures with those from other sites.  Viollet-le-Duc draws attention to the distinct characteristics of the Palenque figures, noting their divergence from the Yucatán style.

**9. The Imposing Ruins of Mitla:** The account describes the ruins of Mitla in Oaxaca, characterized by their monumental scale and highly refined stonework. Viollet-le-Duc contrasts the architectural style of Mitla with that of Palenqué and the Yucatán, emphasizing the lack of timber-style ornamentation:  "à Mitla, pas de sculpture, aucune ornementation autre que celle donnée par l'assemblage de l'appareil..." The author provides detailed descriptions of the palace layout, the unique columned halls, and the intricate mosaic patterns.  The sophisticated masonry suggests a more advanced stage of civilization than Palenqué, although still under a hierarchical theocratic system.

**10. Synthesis and Conclusions:** Viollet-le-Duc synthesizes his observations, proposing a chronological sequence for the development of Mesoamerican architecture.  He suggests that Palenqué represents the oldest phase, followed by the Yucatán sites, and finally Mitla. He explains that while these structures all show a hierarchical society, there are fundamental differences in style and construction that indicate distinct periods and possibly different branches of the same or related civilizations. He discusses the probable intermingling of different racial groups: "...un mélange de races blanches venues du nord-est et de races jaunes aborigènes ou venues du nord-ouest".  The text concludes with a call for further research and the preservation of these invaluable historical sites.

**11. Charnay's Journey:  From Paris to Veracruz:**  The narrative shifts to a first-person account of Charnay's journey, beginning with his departure from Paris and his arrival in Veracruz. He describes Veracruz as having an "oriental" appearance, but emphasizes its commercial rather than religious character: "Essentiellement commerçante...Vera-Cruz est peuplée d'un grand nombre d'étrangers; les affaires lui font oublier l'Église".  He vividly describes the harsh northerly winds and the contrast between the city's drab exterior and the relatively abundant life within its walls.

**12.  Mexico City and its Inhabitants:** Charnay details his arrival in Mexico City, contrasting the initial disappointment with the grand view from the surrounding highlands. The author provides observations on Mexican character, describing the duality between haughtiness and servility, politeness and unreliability. He quotes Dr. Jourdanet’s description of the Mexican physical type:  "Le Mexicain est de taille moyenne; sa physionomie porte l'empreinte de la douceur et de la timidité". He also discusses the prevalence of religious buildings in Mexico City, the elaborate Holy Sacrament processions, and the common occurrence of earthquakes.

**13.  Mexican Customs and Social Commentary:** Charnay offers keen insights into Mexican customs, describing the daily life of various social classes, from the impoverished "leperos" to the wealthy elite.  He recounts the common practice of "pronunciamentos," describing the ease with which individuals could seize power through military coups. He shares anecdotes of his encounters with thieves ("compadres") and the respect shown to priests even despite their often-questionable behaviour. He emphasizes the contrast between Mexico's potential and its widespread social and political problems.

**14. A Perilous Journey to Mitla:** The journey to Mitla is described, highlighting the dangerous condition of the roads and the constant threat of bandits: "La contrée, peuplée de voleurs, n'est point gardée; des attentats quotidiens arrêtent toute circulation".  Charnay recounts the imprisonment of his companion, Pedrito, the encounter with a robbed traveler, and the unexpected meeting with Huero Lopez, a former bandit elevated to the rank of commander. The narrative emphasizes the unpredictable nature of the region.

**15. Oaxaca and its Political Climate:** Charnay's arrival in Oaxaca is described, along with his difficulties with photographic materials.  He describes the city's architecture and market, commenting on the abundance of fruit and the relatively peaceful atmosphere compared to other areas of Mexico. However, the author also details the strong local pride and the pervasive political tensions that threaten the city's stability: "...cet amour-propre excessif à la concentration d'une existence toute locale...". He presents a detailed account of the assassination of a government official, highlighting the impunity enjoyed by criminals and the power wielded by the clergy.

**16.  Exploring Oaxaca's Surroundings and Mitla's Monuments:** Charnay describes his explorations of the surrounding valleys of Oaxaca, including the ancient ruins of Monte Albán.  He explains the challenges he faced due to the deterioration of his photographic materials and the ongoing political turmoil.  His description of Mitla emphasizes the extraordinary quality of the stonework in the palaces and the contrasting poorly-executed wall paintings: "...l'incorrection de ces dessins accolés à des palais d'une architecture si correcte..."   He notes the local belief that the stones from Mitla's mosaics can be transformed into gold.


**17. A Difficult Return to Veracruz:** The account details the second siege of Oaxaca, the author's participation in the city's defense, and the renewed attempts to photograph the ruins of Mitla. He again describes the challenges posed by his photographic supplies and the political unrest. Charnay's return to Veracruz is recounted, including the false reports of his death and his subsequent experiences during the siege of the city.

**18. Yucatán's Second Exploration:** The journey to Chichen Itza is described, emphasizing the dangers posed by the Maya rebels. The author recounts anecdotes of his experiences in the villages, including the strange religious practices in the absence of a priest, and the remarkable skills of the local craftsmen. His photographic work at Chichen Itza is detailed, along with his observations about the ruins' architecture and the indigenous population. He recounts an encounter with a local musician who used a primitive violin made from wood and animal gut.

**19. Uxmal's Grand Structures and Unexpected Dangers:** The exploration of Uxmal is detailed, with descriptions of the architecture and the legends surrounding the ruins. The author vividly describes his experience of being attacked by swarms of insects in the ruins.  He recounts the incident of damaging a photograph with a finger print and the subsequent frantic search for replacement chemicals.  His observations on the social structures of Uxmal suggests greater equality compared to other locations: "...une société où l'homme, affranchi des entraves d'une théocratie barbare..."

**20. The Usumascinta River and Palenqué:**  The journey to Palenqué, involving a voyage down the Usumascinta river, is vividly recounted.  Charnay describes his encounters with crocodiles, monkeys, and iguanas, highlighting the challenges of traveling through the dense jungle. The difficulties of his photographic work are emphasized: "Mon expédition à Palenqué fut un insuccès déplorable". The author also describes the unique nocturnal experiences within the ruins of Palenqué, such as encounters with jaguars and the vision of religious apparitions enhanced by fireflies.

**21. From Palenqué to San Cristóbal and Tumbala:** The journey from Palenqué continues, highlighting the difficult terrain and the author's problems with his hired porters who desert him. Charnay provides a striking account of his arduous journey through the jungle. He vividly describes the harsh conditions, encounters with wildlife, and the hostility he encounters from some of the indigenous people. The narrative underscores the resourcefulness and determination required for such an expedition.

**22. San Cristóbal, Chiapas and the Final Journey:**  Charnay describes his arrival in San Cristóbal, obtaining hospitality from a French doctor.  He recounts his experiences with local customs, including a surprising encounter at a church service.  His original plans to explore the ruins around Comitan are abandoned due to lack of resources.  The journey ends with the author's departure for Mexico City, recounting another theft by bandits. The final paragraphs reflect on the complex nature of Mexico and its potential for future development under French influence.

**23. The Ascent of Popocatépetl and its Dramatic Conclusion:** Charnay's ascent of Popocatépetl is detailed, including his preparations, the journey to the base camp, and the challenging climb to the summit. He quotes Prescott's account of earlier explorations: "Une superstition puérile des Indiens avait déifié ces montagnes célèbres...".  He describes the spectacular views from the summit and his descent via a thrilling improvised method involving a hat and the snow.  The journey concludes with his return to Mexico, an encounter with warring factions, and a final robbery near Puebla, where the author's watch is stolen.  The book ends with his departure for Europe.
