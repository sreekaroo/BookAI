# Discoveries Among the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon: A Chronological Summary

## Renewed Expedition to Nineveh

In 1848, Austen Henry Layard returned to England to recover from ill health, leaving further Nineveh excavations uncertain.  Public interest in his initial discoveries, however, prompted the British Museum Trustees to commission a second expedition. Layard's ambitious plan, encompassing both Assyria and Babylonia, was ultimately scaled back to a focus on Nineveh.  He assembled a team including artist Frederick Cooper, Hormuzd Rassam, and physician Dr. Sandwith, departing from Constantinople in August 1849.  Their journey emphasized geographical exploration and political observation, traversing Eastern Armenia and Kurdistan—regions recently brought under Turkish control.


## Journey Through Armenia and Kurdistan

Layard’s journey avoided established trade routes, opting for a path through challenging Armenian and Kurdish terrain.  He described the poor condition of existing caravan routes, highlighting the lack of infrastructure despite the region's significant Persian trade.  He observed Armenian churches with unique architecture, noting its potential influence on later Gothic styles and its aesthetic qualities. In Erzeroom, Layard met Reshid Pasha, a commander who had recently subdued rebellious Armenian tribes, gaining insight into the region's complex political landscape.  Layard also encountered Shahan Bey, a representative of a declining class of Turkish aristocracy, showcasing their hospitality and traditional virtues, contrasting with the impact of the “_tanzimat_” (reforms) designed to centralize the Ottoman Empire.   He documented the transition from cultivated plains to sparsely populated hills, observing the unique Armenian villages described by Xenophon centuries earlier.


## Yezidi Encounters and Return to Mosul

Layard’s journey continued through Armenian and Kurdish territories. He described the unique red Tatar tombs near Akhlat, detailing their architecture and potential historical significance, noting the prevalence of rock-cut tombs and dwellings.  He was greeted enthusiastically by the Yezidi community, experiencing remarkable hospitality that contrasted starkly with prevailing negative stereotypes of the group. In Redwan, Layard examined the Melek Taous (brazen bird), a symbolic figure, not an idol, within the Yezidi faith, further challenging common misconceptions.  His journey to Mosul involved a notable encounter with Hussein Bey and Sheikh Nasr, who journeyed to meet him, demonstrating the Yezidi community's sincere gratitude for Layard's previous advocacy.


## Excavations Resume at Kouyunjik and Nimroud

Upon his return to Mosul, Layard found the Nineveh excavations in a state of limited activity.  He resumed extensive excavations at Kouyunjik, utilizing tunnels to access the buried remains, documenting the discovery of bas-reliefs depicting Assyrian conquests in mountainous regions.  A well discovered amidst the ruins contained both broken pottery and fragments of calcined alabaster sculptures.  The bas-reliefs offered detailed depictions of sieges, invasions, and the transport of captives and spoils. He noted the use of inscriptions to identify conquered peoples and places, lamenting the destruction of the upper parts of slabs, which frequently held crucial identifying inscriptions. Layard also renewed excavations at Nimroud, discovering a stone wall beneath the high conical mound, possibly linked to the tomb of Sardanapalus, but finding only empty chambers.


## Sennacherib's Palace at Kouyunjik

A major breakthrough occurred with the discovery of the grand entrance to the Kouyunjik palace. This impressive façade included colossal bulls and other figures, with inscriptions providing annals of Sennacherib's six-year reign.   Layard highlighted Dr. Hincks' and Col. Rawlinson's pivotal roles in deciphering cuneiform script and identifying Sennacherib as the palace's builder.  The inscriptions chronicled Sennacherib's wars, including conflicts with the Jews, notably mentioning Hezekiah and the siege of Lachish.  Layard's observation of the inscription detailing the taking of Lachish was significant confirmation of biblical accounts.  The discovery of clay seals, including those of Sennacherib and the Egyptian king Sabaco, further corroborated historical records and biblical narratives.


## Removal of Sculptures and Further Discoveries

The removal of the winged lions from Nimroud proved challenging but was eventually completed. Excavations uncovered vaulted drains and painted bricks, providing insights into Assyrian engineering and artistic practices. A Tai Arab attack on Nimroud highlighted the ongoing insecurity of the region. Layard visited the Tai encampment, mediating a truce and fostering relations with their Sheikh.  The discovery of a newly-excavated chamber at Nimroud yielded a wealth of artifacts: large copper caldrons, bells, bronze bowls, cups, dishes, and other metal objects, many ornately embossed with scenes of hunting, battles and religious ceremonies.  The discovery included a royal throne and artifacts revealing the extensive skills of Assyrian metalworkers and their use of bronze and ivory.


## Nighttime Visit and Yezidi Celebrations

Layard's nighttime visit to the winged lions under the full moon highlighted the grandeur and solemnity of these ancient monuments.  A visit to the bitumen springs created a striking image, with Arabs lighting the pits and creating a dramatic scene. The Yezidi marriage festival provided a contrasting scene of vibrant celebrations, further illustrating Layard's interest in and rapport with the region's diverse peoples.  A visit to Bavian revealed notable rock sculptures, with inscriptions identifying Sennacherib as their creator and adding information about irrigation projects and campaigns.  The details and precision of the inscriptions provided valuable chronological insight.


## Khabour Expedition and Arban Excavations

Layard embarked on an expedition to the Khabour River, accompanied by Sheikh Suttum and his rediff.  The journey through the Mesopotamian desert involved encounters with various Arab tribes and a depiction of their nomadic life. Layard's party experienced a fierce desert storm and interacted with the inhabitants of numerous villages. Upon arrival at Arban, he discovered two pairs of winged bulls and a lion carved in a distinctive archaic style.   Excavations revealed small objects, a Chinese bottle, and Egyptian scarabs, indicating the diverse cultural contacts of the Khabour region.


## Life Among the Bedouins

Layard describes life in the Bedouin encampment, focusing on their customs related to food, hospitality, and health. The "Thar," or blood revenge law, is explained as a system regulating order and preventing widespread violence.  The "Dakheel," or system of protection, is also detailed. Layard's time among the Bedouins includes anecdotes on camel riding, falconry, and Bedouin poetry. The expedition continued to the Euphrates, revealing the ingenuity of their building techniques, their respect for hospitality and unique legal systems.  The journey continued to the confluents of the Khabour, where Layard met Suleiman Agha, observing Turkish irregular cavalry.


## Babylon and Southern Mesopotamia

Layard's expedition to Babylon and southern Mesopotamia began after concluding his work in Nineveh. The journey down the Tigris included a stop at Tekrit, observations on the state of the Mesopotamian rivers, and discussion of the potential for future commerce along their banks. Upon arrival in Baghdad, Layard visited Tel Mohammed, where he found some Assyrian artifacts.  He then journeyed to Babylon, encountering a Persian prince, observing eastern falconry, and studying the extensive ruins at Babylon. Layard's excavations focused on the mounds of Babel, the Mujelibé (Kasr), and Amran. He found numerous artifacts, including earthenware bowls with Hebrew and Syriac inscriptions, providing further insights into the Jewish community that remained in the area after the Babylonian captivity.  Layard also visited the Birs Nimroud, detailing its massive structure and the abundance of Nebuchadnezzar's bricks, noting the lack of earlier remains. The expedition moved south, crossing sand hills and encountering various Arab tribes before arriving at Niffer. He describes excavating numerous earthenware coffins and analyzing the remains found at Niffer. Layard concluded his journey with a return to Baghdad, a summary of discoveries at Kalah Sherghat, and a description of further discoveries at Nineveh in his absence.


##  Conclusion and Significance of Discoveries

Layard's final paragraphs reflect on his experiences in Mesopotamia. The discoveries made at Nineveh and Babylon significantly advanced the understanding of Assyrian and Babylonian history, culture, and chronology.  He emphasizes the meticulous record-keeping of Assyrian kings in their annals, comparing their approach to that of the Hebrew chroniclers.   Layard highlights the decipherment of cuneiform script, identifying numerous kings, cities, and events mentioned in the Bible. He discusses the political structure of the Assyrian empire, noting its nature as a confederation of tributary states.  Layard examines the extensive use of irrigation in Mesopotamia and speculates on the extent of Nineveh, emphasizing its fortifications and noting the lack of clearly identified Assyrian tombs.  He provides reconstructions of the palaces at Kouyunjik and Nimroud, detailing their architecture and decorations.  The book concludes with reflections on the significance of the discoveries, the contrast between the Assyrian and Jewish approaches to record-keeping, and the enduring legacy of these ancient civilizations.
