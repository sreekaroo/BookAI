# A Chronological Summary of Maspero's Manual of Egyptian Archaeology

This summary organizes the provided text chronologically, focusing on the evolution of Egyptian architecture, art, and industrial practices.

## 1. Prehistoric and Early Dynastic Housing

The book begins by acknowledging the scarcity of scholarly attention on Egyptian houses, contrasting with the focus on temples and tombs.  Maspero notes that significant remnants of domestic architecture survive, particularly in Memphis, Kahun, and Thebes.  Early dwellings are described as simple structures of wattle and daub, gradually evolving into those built with sun-dried mud bricks.  The author describes the brickmaking process in detail, emphasizing its similarity to modern methods and noting that burnt bricks and tiles were uncommon before the Roman period.  Foundations were shallow, often directly on the ground, resulting in the characteristic mounds of ancient Egyptian towns.

## 2. Early Dynastic Fortifications and Public Works

Maspero details early fortresses, focusing on the examples at Abydos. He describes the construction of these structures, emphasizing their thick, straight walls built in alternating horizontal and concave courses to withstand attacks.  The design included multiple gates designed to slow down invaders,  demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of defensive strategies.  He contrasts this with later fortifications, which incorporated features adapted from Syrian and Canaanite architecture, such as towers (Migdols).  Regarding public works, he notes the limited need for roads due to the Nile's role as the main transport artery.  He does mention the discovery of a bridge at Zarû and discusses the extensive systems of granaries, storehouses, and canals crucial for the Egyptian economy.  The ambitious, yet possibly mythical, Lake Moeris project is discussed.  Maspero expresses skepticism towards the scale and existence of the lake as described by Herodotus.  He highlights the more practical approach of the Egyptians to water management through dikes and reservoirs.

## 3. The Evolution of Temple Architecture (Old Kingdom)

The transition to religious architecture is marked by a shift from brick to stone as the primary building material, reflecting the desire for lasting structures for the gods. The author details the construction techniques, including the use of varied stone types, sometimes with a core of rougher material and carefully dressed casing stones.  Foundations remained relatively shallow, relying on the compact soil.  Mortar usage varied, and the author notes the use of metal cramps and wooden dovetails. The text then introduces the simplest known temple, the Temple of the Sphinx, characterized by its austere beauty and monolithic pillars, lacking the elaborate decoration of later temples.


## 4. Temple Architecture: The Middle and New Kingdoms

Maspero moves on to describing the typical layout of larger temples, starting with the sanctuary, the innermost and most sacred space, and expanding outward through various halls, courtyards, and pylons.  He explains the gradual increase in size and complexity over centuries, with each pharaoh often adding to existing structures. Examples like the temples of Elephantine, El Kab, and Khonsû at Karnak are used to illustrate variations on the basic layout.  The text also details the use of rock-cut temples (Speos), found in narrower parts of the Nile Valley and Nubia.  These structures adapted the conventional temple layout to the limitations of the rock face, sometimes combining excavated chambers with above-ground construction, as seen in Deir el Bahari. The description of the temple at Abydos shows the flexibility of the basic temple plan under specific circumstances.


## 5. Temple Decoration and Symbolism

Maspero delves into the elaborate decoration of temples.  He emphasizes the symbolic representation of the cosmos within the temple structure—the earth, pillars supporting the sky, and the celestial bodies.  The decoration followed a hierarchical order, with vegetation motifs at the bottom, scenes of daily life and royal activities in the middle registers, and celestial scenes on the ceilings.  He notes the consistent depiction of the pharaoh as the intermediary between gods and people, emphasizing the dual symmetry often present in the tableaux. The use of color, its symbolism, and its role in the magical properties of the decoration are discussed.  Maspero argues that the profuse decoration was not merely aesthetic, but also served magical and protective purposes.


## 6. The Mastaba: Tomb Architecture of the Old Kingdom

The discussion shifts to tombs, starting with the mastabas of the Old Kingdom.  Maspero carefully describes their structure: a rectangular, flat-topped building with a slightly sloped exterior, built of stone or brick. The internal arrangements are detailed, including the "false door" (a symbolic doorway for the Ka), the chapel (for offerings and rituals), and the shaft leading to the subterranean burial chamber.  The author emphasizes the importance of orientation and the often-rudimentary foundations. The function of the serdab, a small chamber within the mastaba containing statues of the deceased, is also explained.


## 7.  Pyramid Construction: Royal Tombs of the Old Kingdom

The section on pyramids expands upon the mastaba design.  The author, drawing on the work of Flinders Petrie, presents the pyramid as a monumental version of the mastaba, incorporating a separate chapel, passageways, and a burial chamber.  The construction materials, primarily stone and brick, are discussed, along with the challenges of orientation and the varying sizes of pyramids, dispelling some previous theories on their construction.  The Great Pyramid of Khufu is analyzed in detail, focusing on its complex internal passages and the ingenious engineering solutions used to prevent collapse.  Maspero then compares and contrasts this design with those of the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure.

## 8.  Theban Tombs: Middle and New Kingdoms

The transition to Theban tombs marks the shift to rock-cut tombs and the pyramid-mastaba hybrid form. The author discusses tombs built of large, unbaked bricks, often with a mastaba base topped by a small pyramid.  The shift towards completely rock-cut tombs is described, illustrating this with examples from Beni Hasan, Syene, and Siut. Maspero highlights the development of the façade, sometimes simply cut from the rock face, sometimes elaborate with porticoes and doorways. He details the typical layout, with chapels adorned with scenes of daily life, offerings, and the deceased's activities.  The importance of the niche for the Ka statues is again emphasized.

## 9.  The Tombs of the Theban Kings: A Royal Necropolis

Maspero moves to the Royal Tombs of Thebes, located in the Valley of the Kings. He explains the unique challenges of building in this constrained valley, leading to irregularities in tomb layout and overlapping excavations.  The tombs of Rameses IV and Seti I are used as examples, emphasizing their complex passageways and chambers designed to confuse tomb robbers.  The author contrasts the elaborate decoration of the royal tombs with those of commoners.  He particularly notes the symbolic depiction of the journey of the soul in the afterlife, mirroring the actual geography of the tomb.  The text also highlights the increasing use of papyrus and amulets to protect the mummy and soul.

## 10. Egyptian Painting and Sculpture: Styles and Techniques

Maspero turns to the artistic practices, noting the close relationship between painting and sculpture.  The use of models in teaching is described, along with the development of drawing techniques, especially the use of reed brushes for outlining figures. The conventional style of Egyptian art, particularly the use of profile views combined with frontal elements, is explained.  Maspero analyzes the composition and perspective in tomb paintings, noting the lack of traditional perspective but also the sophisticated ability to convey narrative and action.  He compares Egyptian compositions to those of the Palestrina mosaic to clarify the principles.


## 11. Egyptian Sculpture: From the Old Kingdom to the Roman Period

The text moves to Egyptian sculpture, beginning with the Great Sphinx, which exemplifies the mastery of the earliest known sculpture. Maspero distinguishes the stylistic characteristics of the Memphite, Theban, and Saite schools. The Memphite school is represented by detailed, lifelike portraits. The Theban school of the New Kingdom displays a broader range of subjects and increased dynamism, while the Saite school shows refined elegance and mastery of various materials, including basalt and serpentine. The evolution of sculpture from the Old to the New Kingdom is detailed with examples such as the "Cross-legged Scribe" and the colossi of Amenhotep III and Rameses II. The later influence of Greek art on Egyptian sculpture is discussed, showing a progressive blending of styles in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.


## 12.  Egyptian Industrial Arts: Stone, Clay, and Glass

Maspero explores the Egyptian industrial arts, starting with the lapidary work, emphasizing the wide variety of stones used for jewelry and amulets (scarabs are mentioned prominently). The techniques of cutting, piercing, and polishing are highlighted. The text then explores the production of pottery, from early red and yellow wares to the later glazed wares and faience.  The manufacture of glass, its chemical composition, and the methods for producing colored glass and imitations of precious stones are carefully explained, referencing glass-blowing depictions in tombs.


## 13.  Egyptian Industrial Arts: Wood, Ivory, and Textiles

The use of wood, ivory, and bone in craftsmanship is discussed.  The relative scarcity of suitable wood in Egypt is noted, contrasting with the skillful use of what was available, such as sycamore and acacia, for furniture and statuettes.  The detailed description of the wooden statuettes shows the high level of craftsmanship.  The importance of textiles in daily life and burial practices is discussed, including tapestry-making and the renowned fine linens and muslins.   The text provides detailed descriptions of furniture such as chests, beds, chairs, and sledges, many of which were used for funerary purposes and decorated with painted or inlaid elements.


## 14.  Egyptian Metallurgy and Jewelry

Maspero concludes with a discussion of Egyptian metallurgy. He details the use of iron, lead, and bronze, with a focus on bronze and its alloys, used for everything from tools and weapons to household utensils and statuary. The author highlights the skilled work in _repoussé_ and chasing, and mentions the use of gilding and inlaying with precious metals.  The extensive use of gold and silver in jewelry, religious artifacts, and decorative objects is discussed, focusing on the sophisticated techniques employed by Egyptian goldsmiths.  The author explains the role of jewelry in both daily life and funerary practices, and mentions the lavish jewelry found with mummies like Queen Aahhotep, highlighting the quality and detail of craftsmanship.  The summary concludes by observing the decline of the arts under the later Ramessides and the eventual integration of Greek and Roman styles, leading to the eventual demise of purely Egyptian artistic traditions.
