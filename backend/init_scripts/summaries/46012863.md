# The Excavations at Babylon: A Chronological Summary

This summary provides a chronological overview of Robert Koldewey's *The Excavations at Babylon*, detailing the project's progress and significant discoveries.

## **Initial Investigations and the Decision to Excavate**

Koldewey's initial visits to Babylon in 1887 and 1897 revealed fragments of enamelled brick reliefs, sparking interest in the site's potential.  The beauty and historical significance of these fragments convinced the Royal Museums in Berlin, under R. Schöne, to undertake a full-scale excavation of the ancient city.  Excavations officially began on March 26, 1899, on the east side of the Kasr, north of the Ishtar Gate.

## **Uncovering the Procession Street and the Principal Citadel**

By the end of 1899, the Procession Street of Marduk had been unearthed as far as the north-east corner of the Principal Citadel. A cross-cut through the Citadel's north front provided further insights into the city's layout.  The discovery of the street's pavement,  "Nebuchadnezzar, King of Babylon, son of Nabopolassar, King of Babylon, am I. The Babel Street I paved with blocks of shadu stone for the procession of the great Lord Marduk," immediately highlighted the importance of the undertaking.

## **Temple of Ninmach and Early Structures**

In 1900, the team excavated the Temple of Ninmach (E-Mach), revealing its layered construction and evidence of multiple periods of renovation. The discovery of a bronze ferrule from a doorpost, along with an Emach cylinder inscription of Sardanapalus, provided crucial dating information. This temple, like others, exhibited vertical grooves on its walls, a distinctive feature of Babylonian temple architecture.

## **The Southern Citadel: Palace of Nebuchadnezzar**

Work progressed in 1900 and 1901 to the Southern Citadel, revealing the palace of Nebuchadnezzar.  The excavations uncovered various courts and chambers, demonstrating a complex and multi-phased construction.  Inscribed bricks provided evidence that parts of the palace dated back to Nebuchadnezzar's father, Nabopolassar, while much of the structure was a testament to Nebuchadnezzar's massive building projects.  The discovery of multiple brick stamps with variations in inscriptions helped date different parts of the complex.

## **The Ishtar Gate: A Masterpiece of Enamelled Brickwork**

The excavation of the Ishtar Gate (1902) proved to be a pivotal moment. The gate's massive walls, adorned with enamelled reliefs of lions, bulls, and dragons, were a spectacular discovery.  Koldewey meticulously documented the gate's construction, including expansion joints, and the innovative techniques used in creating the enamelled bricks.  Inscriptions helped to identify the gate and the animals represented as sacred symbols.

## **The Procession Street and Related Structures**

The Procession Street, south of the Ishtar Gate, was further excavated, revealing its multiple layers of pavement and its association with religious processions. The discovery of limestone projectiles and canals, also carefully documented, gave more clues to the city's functional aspects, and confirmed Nebuchadnezzar's work on the Libil-ḫigalla canal. 

## **The Principal Citadel: Fortifications and Royal Palace**

In 1904, excavation shifted to the Principal Citadel, revealing a complex of massive fortifications, including a 17-meter-thick wall of burnt brick laid in asphalt. A basalt lion, damaged by time and human intervention,  highlighted the power and religious aspects of the Citadel.

## **Etemenanki: The Tower of Babel**

The excavation of the peribolos of Etemenanki (the Tower of Babel), starting in 1908, revealed multiple building phases, highlighted by the various inscriptions found on the bricks.  The immense scale of the structure was underscored by the sheer volume of debris located at Homera, implying the complete destruction of the tower itself. This was corroborated by historical records of Alexander's efforts to clear the site before rebuilding.

## **Esagila: The Temple of Marduk**

Deep excavations under the Amran mound revealed Esagila, the temple of Marduk.  Multiple layers of pavements, inscribed bricks, and the presence of a postament for Marduk's statue were among the many finds.  The careful and detailed documentation provided insights into temple design, ceremonial practices, and the use of various materials. The extensive debris from Esagila confirmed its long history of occupation, additions, and destruction.

## **Merkes: Everyday Life in Babylon**

The excavations at Merkes (1908-1912) shed light on the daily lives of ordinary Babylonians.  Multiple layers of dwellings, streets, and numerous artifacts provided a comprehensive picture of the city's residential areas.  Tablets, pottery, tools, and burials from various historical periods detailed the evolving culture and material conditions of the city from its earliest kings to the Graeco-Parthian period.  The presence of a Greek theatre underscored the city's continued multicultural activity long after its Babylonian prominence.  Detailed plans of houses were reconstructed from the many fragments, showing a remarkably consistent design over millennia.
