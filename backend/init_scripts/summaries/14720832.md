# Ancient Town Planning: A Chronological Summary

This summary chronologically outlines F. Haverfield's "Ancient Town-Planning," detailing key arguments and examples.


## 1. The Intermittent Art of Town Planning

Haverfield begins by establishing town planning as an art that flourishes only under specific conditions:  periods of significant town foundation or expansion, and a societal ethos prioritizing the well-being of average citizens.  He contrasts this with eras and cultures where town development was characterized by haphazard growth, dominated by a few key structures (temples, churches, castles) and lacking a unified, planned design.  He mentions pre-modern Europe and much of Asia as examples where these conditions were not consistently met.

## 2. The Emergence of Straight Lines and Right Angles

The author argues that the adoption of straight lines and right angles marks a pivotal shift from barbarism to civilization in town planning. This is evident in the stark contrast between Roman roads—proverbially straight—and their less-organized British counterparts that followed natural contours. This basic principle, the combination of straight lines and right angles, forms the basis of most ancient town planning, exemplified in a variety of schemes, from pure chessboard patterns to more flexible rectangular layouts.


## 3. Mesopotamian Influences: Babylon and Beyond

Haverfield explores the potential origins of town planning in Mesopotamia, focusing on Babylon. He critically examines Herodotus's account of Babylon, acknowledging its likely exaggeration of scale but recognizing its value in suggesting early forms of town planning with straight streets intersecting at right angles.  Excavations at Babylon's Babil and Kasr sites reveal a more nuanced picture than Herodotus presents.   They illustrate the importance of processional avenues, such as the Aiburschabu, designed for religious processions, but also uncover limited evidence of regular rectangular layouts in residential areas.  He briefly mentions other Mesopotamian sites like Asshur and Nineveh, which show similar elements but lack the comprehensive chessboard planning observed in later Greek and Roman cities.


## 4. Early Greek Town Planning: Limited Scope

The fifth century B.C. marks the beginnings of Greek town planning, though it remained relatively rudimentary.  Haverfield highlights the contrast between the magnificent public buildings and the often squalid, haphazardly arranged dwellings of Athens and Sparta. He introduces Hippodamus of Miletus as a pivotal figure, credited with introducing wider streets and better house grouping, but acknowledges the lack of detailed information about his theories and specific projects. The Piraeus, Thurii, and (possibly) Rhodes are named as cities planned by, or attributed to, Hippodamus, illustrating a move towards rectangular street schemes but without consistent chessboard regularity.  Selinus and Cyrene are cited as further examples of this era's more limited, yet significant, steps towards town planning, demonstrating two main streets crossing at right angles but without uniform development.



## 5. Fourth-Century Greek Developments: Municipal Regulations

The early fourth century B.C. witnessed an evolution in Greek town life reflected in the appearance of municipal by-laws and specialized officials (Agoranomi and Astynomi) to manage markets and streets.  Haverfield notes that while these regulations don't directly address town planning, they represent a growing concern for urban organization and citizen well-being, setting the stage for more methodical city planning.  He cites Plato's "Laws" as evidence for these developments, pointing to regulations concerning building codes and street maintenance.



## 6. The Macedonian Era: The Rise of Chessboard Planning

The Macedonian era brought a shift towards more systematic town planning, particularly the widespread adoption of the "chessboard" pattern. This is linked to Alexander the Great's conquests and the subsequent founding of numerous Graeco-Macedonian cities throughout the Near East.  Haverfield cites examples like Alexandria and Nicaea, where the regular street layout was employed, but notes that no specific architect or ruler is definitively linked to the invention of this pattern.  He speculates on a possible connection between the military nature of the founding generals and soldiers and the adoption of this rigidly structured pattern, drawing parallels with similar trends in later Roman and medieval contexts.


## 7. Case Studies in Macedonian Town Planning: Priene and Miletus

Haverfield details the well-preserved example of Priene, whose refounded layout—covering about 750 by 500 yds.— demonstrates a clear chessboard pattern with regular house blocks (40 x 50 yds.), streets running parallel and perpendicular to each other, and a central Agora. However, he notes a lack of open spaces and gardens. Miletus provides a similar example of regular house blocks (32 x 60 yds.), though with a slightly different shape compared to Priene.  The author acknowledges the challenges of dating accurately and the difficulties in fully understanding the original state of these cities based on extant evidence. He touches upon Alexandria, admitting difficulties in interpreting available excavation data due to subsequent changes and modifications.


## 8. Early Italian Town Planning: Pre-Roman Foundations

Haverfield investigates potential Italian predecessors to the Roman town planning system, beginning with the Terremare settlements of the Bronze Age.  He describes Castellazzo di Fontanellato as a prominent example, featuring a four-sided, quasi-rectangular layout with internal streets and a separate "citadel." He notes that the Terremare's trapezoidal shape, with its ditch and water channels, may represent a possible precedent for the later Roman fondness for non-perfectly-rectangular layouts. Marzabotto provides another intriguing but less certain example of possible pre-Roman, possibly Etruscan town planning exhibiting rectangular street plans.  He acknowledges that the Etruscan's relation to Roman town-planning is a subject of debate.


## 9. Pompeii: A Complex Case Study of Pre-Roman & Roman Elements

Haverfield analyzes Pompeii's development, challenging the traditional view that the entire city was laid out in a single, unified plan.  He proposes a model where an initial, smaller settlement, possibly Oscan or Etruscan, grew through accretion, leading to the incorporation of regions with slightly different, yet seemingly organized, street orientations. Pompeii's partly trapezoidal shape and its lack of perfect right angles are viewed as potentially linking it to earlier Italian traditions and Roman military engineering practices rather than a purely Greek influence.  He concludes that complete understanding of Pompeii's development will require further excavation and analysis. Other early Italian cities such as Norba are mentioned as further examples of early attempts at town planning.


## 10. The Roman System: A Fusion of Greek and Italian Influences

Haverfield argues that Roman town planning represents a fusion of Greek and Italian influences. He suggests that Greek influences refined the existing Italian system, resulting in more mathematically precise and symmetrical layouts. He discusses the prevalence of the "chess-board" pattern, where two main streets divide the town into four quadrants, and other parallel streets create regular house blocks ('insulae').  He notes variations in 'insulae' dimensions (squares, oblongs, &c.) and the sometimes abnormal size of blocks along main streets. He also notes the use of the Roman land measure, the "iugerum," influencing the dimension of insulae. While the "cardo" and "decumanus" are mentioned, the author highlights the lack of solid evidence for other technical surveying terms used by modern scholars.


## 11. Italian Town Planning Examples: Turin, Aosta, Florence, Lucca

Haverfield provides several examples of Roman town planning in Italy, emphasizing the preservation of street patterns in several northern Italian cities.  Turin is presented as a prime example, with well-preserved streets that clearly follow the Roman "chess-board" pattern, even influencing modern city development. Aosta, founded by Augustus, is another case study with a similar rectangular plan.  Florence and Lucca exemplify how the regular Roman plan has been adapted and partially obscured over time but still influences modern urban development.  He then discusses Herculaneum, a smaller Roman town whose rectangular plan, while evident, is more fragmentary and its origins are less certain.  Naples is a final case study, unique because of its use of very long, narrow oblong house blocks (unparalleled elsewhere except perhaps in Carthage), which he connects to the city's Greek origins, but he emphasizes their adaptation to a Roman system.


## 12. Roman Provincial Town Plans: Evidence from the West

Haverfield shifts the focus to Roman provincial town planning, noting that unlike Italy, most provincial towns have lost most of their Roman streets. The scarcity of street survivals necessitates reliance on archaeological excavation. Orange (in Gaul) is cited as an important exception; its inscription details a property lease on an oblong insula, providing direct textual evidence of Roman town planning and revealing the underlying structure of the town.  Timgad (in North Africa) and Carthage are presented as extensive examples where excavation has revealed a well-defined rectangular street system and insulae, showcasing the widespread use of Roman planning in the provinces.


## 13. Roman Provincial Towns: Autun, Trier, Silchester, Caerwent

Further examples of Roman town planning in the provinces are provided through Autun and Trier (in Gaul), demonstrating a chessboard pattern in the original foundation of these cities although subsequent expansion may have obscured the full extent of the plan.  Silchester and Caerwent (in Roman Britain) present different aspects of Roman town planning.  While both exhibit a chessboard pattern, their private housing consists of large, self-contained villas instead of urban dwellings.  This shows the limited adoption of true urban life in Roman Britain. Caerwent is described as smaller and more densely packed than Silchester, reflecting the value of land in this more peripheral Roman town.


## 14. Roman Building Laws and Their Limitations

The author considers the legal and administrative aspects of Roman town planning, noting a relative lack of detailed legal texts explicitly outlining town planning principles. He highlights clauses in municipal charters prohibiting the destruction or alteration of buildings without permission, along with regulations against structures impeding light and air in streets, and placement of cemeteries and brickyards outside the city.  The overall absence of comprehensive legislation, however, is noteworthy. The author emphasizes that local authorities likely needed higher approval for significant changes.


## 15. The End and Legacy of Roman Town Planning

Haverfield concludes by examining the fate of Roman town planning. While it contributed to the organization and strength of Roman cities, its influence largely disappeared after the fall of the Roman Empire, with few towns retaining their original street patterns.  However, the system's legacy is profound, as seen in the thirteenth-century revival of rectangular planning in several European and Asian towns.   He contrasts the relatively small scales of ancient towns with the vastness of modern cities, noting the dramatically different challenges facing modern town planners in dealing with populations, industry, and environmental issues.  Despite the vastly changed circumstances, the basic need for planned and organized urban development persists as a key element shaping modern cities.  The author concludes by observing how deeply modern city life remains influenced by the Roman world, despite the significant changes that have occurred since the ancient world.
