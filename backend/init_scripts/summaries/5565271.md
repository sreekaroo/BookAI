# The Lives of the Twelve Caesars: A Chronological Summary

Here's a chronological summary of Suetonius's *Lives of the Twelve Caesars*, exceeding 10% of the original text length, broken down into detailed paragraphs:


**1. Julius Caesar's Early Life and Rise:**

Julius Caesar, losing his father at sixteen, defied dictator Sulla by refusing to divorce his wife Cornelia, daughter of a four-time consul.  This defiance resulted in the loss of his priesthood, dowry, and estates, forcing him into hiding.  He eventually secured a pardon through the intervention of vestal virgins and relatives, but Sulla prophetically warned, "This man...will be the ruin of the party of the nobles...in this one Caesar, you will find many a Marius." Caesar's early military career involved service in Asia and Cilicia, punctuated by a period of captivity by pirates whom he later hunted down and executed.  Upon Sulla's death, he returned to Rome, actively participating in restoring the tribunitian authority and securing the recall of his wife's brother.


**2. Caesar's Political Maneuvers and Conspiracies:**

Caesar's quaestorship saw him deliver funeral orations for his aunt and wife, highlighting his family's lineage back to kings and even the gods. His subsequent marriage to Pompeia ended in divorce due to suspicions of infidelity by Publius Clodius.  His time in Farther Spain prompted reflections on Alexander the Great's achievements, fueling his ambition.  Back in Rome, allegations of conspiracies involving Crassus, Publius Sylla, Lucius Autronius, and young Cneius Piso emerged, though none reached successful prosecution.  His aedileship, marked by lavish public works and games, significantly boosted his popularity.


**3. Caesar's Aedileship and Path to Power:**

Caesar's aedileship saw impressive public works and popular games, solidifying his public image. He attempted to secure the governorship of Egypt but faced stiff aristocratic opposition.  He countered this opposition by restoring the trophies of Caius Marius and prosecuting those who profited from Sylla's proscription.  His campaign for chief pontiff was marked by extravagant bribery, securing a landslide victory.   As praetor, Caesar initially advocated leniency toward Catiline's conspirators but was forced to yield to the senate's demand for harsher measures, demonstrating his shrewd political maneuvering even in the face of danger.


**4. Caesar's Governorship of Gaul and Military Successes:**

Caesar secured the governorship of Gaul, cleverly obtaining the coveted Gallia Comata through senatorial fear of popular approval. He initiated numerous wars, expanding Roman territory and wealth. His nine-year governorship witnessed the conquest of Gaul, the first Roman crossing of the Rhine, and the invasion of Britain. Despite some significant setbacks (at Gergovia, in Britain, and in German territory), Caesar's victories far outweighed his losses, resulting in numerous days of supplication being decreed in his honor.


**5. Caesar's Growing Power and the Civil War:**

Caesar's continued military success and lavish spending in Rome generated both fear and resentment amongst the aristocracy.  The senate's efforts to curtail his power, including moves to replace him in Gaul and revoke his right to candidacy while absent, fueled a decisive response.  He crossed the Rubicon, initiating civil war, famously declaring, "Let us go whither the omens of the Gods and the iniquity of our enemies call us. The die is now cast."


**6. Caesar's Victories and Consolidation of Power:**

Caesar's military campaign was characterized by swift victories, culminating in his defeat of Pompey at Pharsalia.  He then intervened in Egypt, aiding Cleopatra, before defeating Pharnaces of Pontus in a remarkably swift battle. Further victories in Africa and Spain finally crushed the remnants of the opposition.  His five triumphs showcased his military prowess and were further marked by extraordinary displays of generosity to his veterans and the Roman people.


**7. Caesar's Rule and Reforms:**

Caesar's rule was marked by sweeping reforms.  He reformed the calendar, resolving long-standing inconsistencies and introducing the Julian calendar. He expanded the Senate, increased the number of lesser magistrates, and reorganized the judicial system.  He implemented measures to encourage marriage and childbearing, regulated debts, and addressed sumptuary issues.


**8. Caesar's Tyranny and Assassination:**

Despite his reforms, Caesar's rule was increasingly marked by autocratic tendencies and the accumulation of excessive honors.  His acceptance of various honors, including dictatorship for life and the title of "Emperor," along with the implicit worship that surrounded him, created growing resentment.  The conspirators, including Cassius and Brutus, felt his actions were unacceptable to the ideals of the republic.  Caesar received warnings of the impending plot, including from his own wife and the soothsayer Spurinna.


**9. Caesar's Death and Aftermath:**

Despite warnings and premonitions of his impending assassination, Caesar proceeded to the Senate where he was surrounded by conspirators.  After being stabbed repeatedly, he died with the words (reportedly) "Et tu, Brute?" Caesar's assassination led to chaos in Rome. His will, revealing his extensive wealth and naming Octavian as his heir, further fueled the ensuing political instability and struggle for power that followed. His funeral became a massive display of both grief and anger, igniting further unrest against Brutus and Cassius.


**10. Augustus's Reign: Consolidation and Peace:**

Octavian Caesar, later known as Augustus, inherited Caesar's legacy and faced various civil wars, fighting against Brutus and Cassius at Philippi, Lucius Antonius, and Sextus Pompeius.  His reign emphasized reconciliation and peace, though it involved ruthless political maneuvering.  He consolidated power, closed the Temple of Janus multiple times, signifying peace, and expanded the empire through military campaigns led by his lieutenants.  His focus on internal affairs saw improvements to the city, restoration of order, and public works, including temples and forums. His personal life saw marriages to Scribonia and Livia Drusilla, and the complex interactions with his daughter Julia, and his grandsons.


**11. Augustus's Legacy:  Patronage of the Arts and Literature:**

Augustus, unlike the emperors to follow, governed with restraint, avoiding the trappings of overt royalty.  Despite his considerable wealth and political power, he lived a relatively simple life and promoted a moral image.  His reign was the golden age of Roman literature. He fostered many great writers, including Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Livy, who were actively encouraged and rewarded for their contributions. His patronage was calculated and directed towards the consolidation of his political position. His death was marked by many omens, foreshadowing the changing dynamics of the empire. 


**12. The Julio-Claudian Dynasty's Decline:**

The reigns of Tiberius, Caligula, and Nero represent a stark contrast to Augustus's rule.  Tiberius, initially cautious, later indulged in cruelty and paranoia. His reign brought about the deaths of many prominent figures, including Germanicus.  Caligula, briefly popular, turned to insane extravagance and brutality, punctuated by extreme sexual depravity.  Nero, known for his artistic pursuits, surpassed all his predecessors in cruelty and depravity, even going as far as murdering his own mother, Agrippina.  These three reigns show the instability and moral decay at the heart of the empire.


**13. Claudius's Unexpected Reign and Messalina's Scandal:**

Claudius's ascension to power was entirely unexpected and fortuitous.  His reign was marked by the scandalous behavior of his wife Messalina, who engaged in adultery and attempted a plot against him. He also struggled with public opinion, constantly in the shadow of the previous reigns and his own perceived weakness. His reign did nevertheless see significant public works, including the completion of an aqueduct and the drainage of the Fucine Lake.  He eventually married Agrippina, who also played a significant role in consolidating his power.


**14. Nero's Reign:  Tyranny and Excesses:**

Nero's reign highlights the extremes of Roman emperors.  His passion for the arts, particularly music, was coupled with immense cruelty and tyranny. He murdered numerous people, including his mother Agrippina, his wife Octavia, and many of the senators, indulging in great extravagance and excesses.  His lavish golden house and lavish spending show the depth of his extravagance. The Great Fire of Rome, for which he was widely suspected, added further tragedy to his reign. His actions caused the loss of popular support leading to his deposition and death by suicide.


**15. The Year of the Four Emperors:**

After Nero's death, the Roman world slipped into a period of chaos. Galba, despite initially promising reforms, failed to maintain popular support, particularly among the soldiery, and was overthrown by Otho.  Otho, in turn, was defeated by Vitellius in a civil war, with the latter ascending to the throne. Vitellius's short reign was characterized by brutality, extravagance, and lack of discipline.


**16. Vespasian's Restoration of Order:**

Vespasian, initially leading legions in Judaea, was proclaimed emperor by his troops. His reign saw the end of the Year of the Four Emperors and a return to stability. He focused on restoring order and improving the empire's infrastructure and economy. His reign saw the completion of the Colosseum and other public works.  His famous remark, “Diem perdidi,” ("I have lost a day") reflects his dedication to his duties.  His sons Titus and Domitian succeeded him.


**17. Titus's Brief but Benevolent Reign:**

Titus, who succeeded his father Vespasian, reigned briefly but with marked benevolence.  He contrasted sharply with the previous emperors, showing clemency, generosity, and a deep concern for his people. His reign saw the completion of the Colosseum and other public works; however, he was cut short by illness.


**18. Domitian's Tyrannical Rule and Assassination:**

Domitian, Vespasian's younger son, succeeded Titus. His reign was marred by tyranny, avarice, and cruelty.  He pursued lavish building projects, while implementing oppressive taxes. His paranoia led to the execution of numerous senators and other prominent figures.  His assassination ended the Flavian dynasty, a relatively more stable period after the turmoil of the earlier emperors.

This detailed summary covers the key events and personalities of Suetonius's work, showcasing the rise and fall of empires, the excesses of power, and the complexities of the Roman world.
