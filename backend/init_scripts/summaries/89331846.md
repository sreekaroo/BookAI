# The Go-Getter: A Summary in Chronological Paragraphs

**I. Cappy Ricks' Lament: A Crisis in Management**

The story opens with Cappy Ricks, the powerful head of Ricks Logging & Lumbering Company and Blue Star Navigation Company, expressing his dissatisfaction with his younger managers, Skinner and Peasley.  He complains about the escalating problems in their overseas operations, particularly the mismanagement and embezzlement by Henderson in the Shanghai office. Cappy directly blames their poor judgment in choosing and trusting Henderson.  He highlights the irony of his own perceived retirement, stating,  “I admit you two boys are running my affairs and ordinarily you run them rather well, but--but--ahem! Harumph-h-h!” This sets the stage for the central conflict: the need for a new, capable manager in Shanghai.


**II. The Search for a Go-Getter: A Failure of Judgment**

Skinner and Peasley defend their choice of Henderson, citing his past performance and experience within the company.  However, Cappy points out their failure to test Andrews, a promising but younger employee, for greater responsibility. Cappy criticizes their reluctance to promote younger individuals, exclaiming, "This is a young man's world, Skinner, and don't you ever forget it. The go-getters of this world are under thirty years of age."  This reveals Cappy's belief in the importance of initiative and courage, qualities he believes are more prevalent in younger individuals.  The discussion culminates in Cappy taking on the responsibility of finding Henderson's replacement.

**III.  Enter William E. Peck:  An Unconventional Applicant**

Unexpectedly, William E. Peck, a wounded war veteran, arrives seeking employment. Peck's confident and direct approach immediately captivates Cappy.  He boldly declares, "I've called for my job," demonstrating a self-assuredness that impresses Cappy. Peck concisely outlines his experience and his unwavering determination, stating, "I am a salesman... I am about to sell myself to you." This contrasts sharply with the hesitant and cautious approach of Skinner and Peasley.  Cappy, charmed by Peck's self-confidence, recognizes potential even though he is officially retired.

**IV.  Cappy's Intervention:  A Test of Character**

Initially, Skinner and Peasley dismiss Peck due to a lack of direct experience and the perceived need for older, more established candidates. However, Cappy overrules them, placing Peck under Skinner's supervision as a test of his abilities.  Cappy's words reveal his strategic thinking: "We'll send Andrews out on the next boat, but inform him that his position is temporary. Then if he doesn't make good out there we can take him back into this office, where he is a most valuable man." This reflects Cappy's pragmatic approach and willingness to take calculated risks.

**V. Peck's Sales Prowess:  Exceeding Expectations**

Peck quickly proves his worth, showcasing remarkable salesmanship despite his physical limitations.  He secures new accounts and consistently exceeds sales targets, even selling difficult-to-market lumber like "skunk spruce".  His success is acknowledged, albeit grudgingly, by Skinner. This demonstrates Peck's resilience, resourcefulness, and ability to overcome obstacles.  The quote, "I can sell anything—at a price," summarizes his self-belief and determination.

**VI. Cappy's Plan: The Degree of the Blue Vase**

Impressed by Peck's sales performance, Cappy devises a final test – "the Degree of the Blue Vase." He assigns Peck the seemingly impossible task of acquiring a specific blue vase for a friend's anniversary, setting a tight deadline. This is not a straightforward errand but a carefully constructed trial designed to assess Peck's problem-solving skills, resourcefulness, and tenacity under pressure.

**VII.  The Quest for the Blue Vase:  A Series of Obstacles**

Peck's search for the vase becomes a comedic yet stressful odyssey. He encounters numerous obstacles including a misplaced store, incorrect spelling of the owner's name, and uncooperative shopkeepers. This emphasizes the challenging nature of the test and highlights Peck's perseverance in the face of adversity.  The numerous calls to different Cohens demonstrate his relentless pursuit of his objective, even when overwhelmed.


**VIII.  Financial and Logistical Hurdles:  Testing Limits**

Peck faces further challenges when he discovers the high cost of the vase and the inability to access the necessary funds on a Sunday night.  His calls to Skinner and Peasley are met with indifference and inaction, highlighting the limitations of the existing management structure and Peck's self-reliance. He is forced to use personal possessions as collateral to secure the vase.  This part highlights both Peck's determination and the unexpected problems he solves.


**IX.  A Daring Solution:  A Flight to Santa Barbara**

Faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Peck displays creative problem-solving by chartering a plane to deliver the vase to Cappy, who had already left for Santa Barbara.  This daring solution perfectly illustrates his go-getter spirit and resourcefulness. The act shows his ingenuity, prioritizing his commitment to his chief's request above all else.


**X.  Revelation and Reward:  The Go-Getter's Triumph**

The story concludes with Cappy revealing the true purpose of the blue vase test:  to gauge Peck's suitability for the managerial position in Shanghai.  Cappy acknowledges the difficulty of the task and its emotional impact on Peck but reveals the test's success: Peck's tenacity and loyalty mirrored his former brigadier, someone Cappy himself once tested.  The final exchange between Cappy and Peck, including Peck's quote, "Sir, it shall be done," emphasizes the importance of unwavering commitment and loyalty in achieving success.  Peck's actions showcase the "go-getter" mentality at its peak, exceeding expectations and proving his worth.
