# The New Stone Age in Northern Europe: A Chronological Summary

Here's a chronological summary of the provided text, broken down into detailed paragraphs exceeding 10% of the original text's length:


**1. The Evolutionary Journey to Humanity:** The book begins by establishing the evolutionary lineage of humans, tracing it back through vertebrates, mammals, and primates.  The author emphasizes the "successful minimal adaptation" of our primate ancestors, highlighting their arboreal life as crucial training for future development. This wasn't a case of perfect adaptation, but rather a balance that allowed for eventual terrestrial life.  The text notes that  "Long-continued progress is a marked exception, not the rule, in the animal world, and is maintained only by the 'saving remnant.'" This "saving remnant" was driven by the "spur of necessity" to adapt and evolve, a theme that recurs throughout the book.


**2. Descent from the Trees and the Emergence of *Pithecanthropus*:**  The shift from arboreal to terrestrial life is attributed to climactic changes during the late Miocene and early Pliocene epochs, including cooler temperatures and increasing aridity. This caused the shrinkage of forests and the expansion of grasslands, forcing adaptations.  The author hypothesizes that this descent likely occurred in India or the Iranian plateau, pointing to the rich Siwalik fossil beds as evidence of a diverse and abundant mammalian fauna.  The discovery of *Pithecanthropus erectus* in Java, a hominin species arguably midway between apes and humans, further supports the idea of human origins in this area. The author notes, "Where man's distant cousins, the anthropoid apes, and his still nearer relation, Pithecanthropus, were all living and some, at least, apparently progressing, could hardly have been far from his original home."


**3. Early Human Migrations and Racial Diversification:** From the hypothesized homeland in southwestern Asia, early humans migrated across the globe, adapting to different environments and leading to the diversification into the four main racial groups (Negroids, Mongoloids, Americans, and Caucasians).  The text details the migration routes, with Negroids moving southward, Mongoloids eastward, and Caucasians westward.  The arrival of early humans in Europe is placed within the context of the Great Ice Age, with the glaciers significantly shaping the landscape and influencing human settlement. The author emphasizes that early European populations likely didn't neatly fit into the modern racial classification system.


**4. The Great Ice Age and Early European Inhabitants:** The text discusses the four glacial periods (Gunz, Mindel, Riss, and Wurm) and their interglacial periods.  These periods significantly affected the climate and landscape of Europe, creating tundra, steppe, and eventually forest environments.  The earliest human remains found in Europe are the Heidelberg jaw, dated to the Mindel-Riss interglacial period (approximately 250,000 years ago), which is considered Eolithic.  The Lower Paleolithic period (125,000 - 25,000 B.C.) is associated with Neanderthaloids, while the Upper Paleolithic (25,000 - 10,000 B.C.) marks the arrival of the Cro-Magnons, known for their sophisticated art. The quote from Tacitus about the bleakness of ancient Germany emphasizes the contrast between the perceptions of ancient observers and the realities discovered by archaeologists.


**5. The Transition Period and Shell Mounds:** The Azilian-Tardenoisian epoch represents a transition between the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods. The book focuses on the Danish shell mounds (kitchen middens) as a significant example of this transition.  The author explains, "The age of these shell-heaps is shown approximately by the presence of the auerhahn, proving the neighborhood of pine forests. The charcoal in the fireplaces came from oak wood, showing that oak forests are overspreading the country. The Baltic was more salt than at present, and the shore line was depressed." This indicates a shift from tundra to forest environments. The mounds reveal details of the diet (seafood, birds, and mammals), tools (rudely chipped flint implements), and the domestication of the dog.


**6. Land Dwellings and Settlement Patterns:** The book moves on to describe Neolithic land habitations, including cave dwellings, pit dwellings, and huts.  The author provides examples of different dwelling types, varying in size and complexity, highlighting Grosgartach, a relatively well-preserved Neolithic settlement. The detailed description of Grosgartach's rectangular houses, stalls, and granaries emphasizes the social organization and agricultural practices of this era. The text also touches on fortified villages and their significance in later Neolithic times and the prevalence of loess as a fertile agricultural zone. Tacitus's description of the primitive Finnish dwellings contrasts with the Grosgartach findings, demonstrating the huge variation of Neolithic habitation.


**7. Lake Dwellings and Neolithic Society:**  The chapter explores the famous Swiss lake dwellings, noting their distribution across the Alps and beyond. The construction methods of the platforms and houses, using piles driven into the lakebed and wattle-and-daub construction, are described. The remains found within these settlements showcase agricultural practices (cultivated plants, charred bread), animal domestication (cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, dogs), textile production (flax), and a sophisticated level of social organization indicated by the scale of construction. The author notes Keller's estimation of the large number of piles used, "At the settlement of Wangen 50,000 piles were used, though not all probably at the same time. Messikommer calculated that at Robenhausen over 100,000 were used". 


**8. The Eastern Cradle of Neolithic Culture:**  The origins of the European Neolithic culture are traced eastward to Asia, particularly the Iranian plateau and regions of present-day Turkmenistan. The author discusses Pumpelly's excavations at Anau, revealing evidence of a settled agricultural community dating back to before 8000 B.C.  The findings at Anau, including early domestication of animals, pottery, and evidence of cereal cultivation, demonstrate the antiquity of Neolithic culture in Asia, predating European developments.  The findings in Susa further support this, with even older traces of Neolithic settlements. The author suggests that the increased aridity likely contributed to the abandonment of Anau and to the movements of peoples westward.


**9. Megalithic Monuments and Burial Practices:** The chapter delves into the megalithic structures of Europe, including dolmens, menhirs, and alignments.  The author explains their development, from simple four-stone structures to complex gallery graves. The contents of these monuments provide insights into burial practices, changing from extended burials to crouched burials and eventually to cremation.  This shift suggests a change in religious beliefs and conceptions of the afterlife. The author connects these monuments to the broader culture in the text, stating,  "The wide distribution of these simplest stone monuments is exceedingly interesting. They occur in Denmark and Sweden, in North Germany and Holland, in Great Britain and France, Portugal and Spain, in North Africa, in the Ã†gean Islands, in Palestine and farther eastward, in Thrace and Crimea, along the eastern shore of the Black Sea. They are very numerous in India."


**10. Neolithic Industries and Trade:**  The text discusses Neolithic industries, including the manufacture of stone tools (axes, picks, etc.), pottery, and textiles.  The importance of flint mining and trade is highlighted, with examples like Grand Pressigny in France.  The gradual introduction of copper and finally bronze is linked to the expansion of trade networks, connecting different regions of Europe and linking them with the Near East.  The author notes the role of amber in trade with Scandinavia, exchanging it for metals from southern Europe. The book highlights, "The pottery of the oldest lake-dwellers is crude, coarse, with little or no ornament. Hence it is difficult to connect it with any other type." The chapter emphasizes the importance of pottery in understanding cultural connections and chronological periods.


**11. Neolithic Chronology and Peoples:**  This section attempts to establish a chronology for the Neolithic period in Europe, combining geological evidence (glacial retreat, forest succession) with archaeological findings.  The author discusses various dating methods and their limitations, pointing to the complexities in establishing precise dates for different cultures.  The arrival and spread of various groups, including the Mediterranean race, broad-headed peoples from the east, and the Nordic peoples from the north, are explored.  The text emphasizes the complexity of the migrations and mixtures of cultures. A quote emphasizing the complexity is used, "In the Rhine valley along the middle of the course of the river we find a region of mingling or overlapping cultures which have not yet been satisfactorily disentangled".


**12. Neolithic Religion and the Cult of the Goddess:** This section focuses on Neolithic religious beliefs, highlighting the importance of spirits, taboo, and tribal responsibility. The author uses the example of ancient Greek mysteries to illustrate the likely nature of Neolithic religion in the Mediterranean. The prominence of the goddess-mother in agricultural cultures is discussed, along with mother-right and its implications for the social position of women. The author explains,  "This cult of the goddess seems to have been a marked feature of Neolithic religion. We find it in the remains of the Minoan periods in Crete; Isis and her companion god Osiris were very prominent in Egypt."


**13.  The Indo-European Migrations and Their Impact:**  The final chapter addresses the arrival of Indo-European-speaking peoples in Europe, emphasizing the linguistic aspect rather than purely racial characteristics.  The text examines the dispersal of Indo-European languages and attempts to reconstruct the culture of their original homeland, considering various theories and their strengths and weaknesses.  The author emphasizes the significant impact of Indo-European migrations on the development of European cultures, while noting the ongoing debate about their precise origins and the extent of their influence. The book explains, "The weight of evidence seems to be against any theory which locates the first, original homeland in the far east or in the far northwest. But we deal only with probabilities, and may well 'carry our theories on our finger-tips'."


**14. The Persistence of Neolithic Traditions:** The concluding paragraphs discuss the persistence of Neolithic traditions even after the arrival of Indo-European peoples.  The author suggests that many aspects of European culture and society have roots in Neolithic practices, beliefs, and social structures, and that the "common people" still embody aspects of Neolithic life and values.  The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of studying prehistory to understand the underlying currents of human society and the enduring nature of certain fundamental cultural elements.  The author concludes with a reflection on the ongoing evolution of human society and its potential for future progress.
