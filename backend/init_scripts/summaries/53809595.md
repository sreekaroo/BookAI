# Of the Buildings of Justinian: A Summary

This summary chronologically organizes the key details and significant quotes from Procopius's *Buildings of Justinian*, offering a detailed overview of the emperor's vast construction projects across his empire.


## I. The Restoration of Hagia Sophia

Procopius begins by recounting the destruction of the Hagia Sophia during the Nika riots and its subsequent rebuilding by Emperor Justinian. This project, undertaken with "regardless of expense of all kinds," exemplifies Justinian's dedication.  Anthemius of Tralles, a celebrated architect, and Isidorus of Miletus spearheaded the reconstruction. Procopius describes the awe-inspiring structure: "In height it rises to the very heavens, and overtops the neighbouring buildings like a ship anchored among them," highlighting its scale and grandeur.  He notes the ingenious architectural feats, including the use of lead to bind the stones of the piers and the masterful suspension of the dome: "A spherical-shaped dome standing upon this circle makes it exceedingly beautiful; from the lightness of the building it does not appear to rest upon a solid foundation, but to cover the place beneath as though it were suspended from heaven by the fabled golden chain."  The lavish use of gold and precious materials is also emphasized, with a particularly striking detail: "That part of the church which is especially sacred...contains forty thousand pounds’ weight of silver!"  The text then narrates the structural challenges overcome during the construction, showcasing Justinian's problem-solving abilities.


## II. Public Works in Constantinople

Beyond Hagia Sophia, Justinian's impact on Constantinople is described. The Augustæum, a public square, is detailed, featuring a towering column topped with a colossal bronze equestrian statue of the emperor. Procopius describes the statue's attire and posture, interpreting its symbolism: "He looks towards the east, directing his course, I imagine, against the Persians;...he stretches forward his right hand towards the east, and spreading out his fingers seems to bid the barbarians in that quarter to remain at home and come no further."  Other significant projects mentioned include the reconstruction of the Church of Irene, a large-scale undertaking "scarcely second to any in Byzantium except that of Sophia,"  and three hospices, showing Justinian's care for the poor and afflicted.  Numerous other churches, dedicated to various saints and the Virgin Mary, are mentioned, their sheer number highlighting the scale of Justinian's building program.


## III. Churches and Fortifications in Byzantium's Suburbs

The book continues with a focus on churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary, particularly one built at Blachernæ near the sea-shore and another near the Golden Gate.  Procopius describes the architectural details and the strategic placement of these buildings, emphasizing their dual purpose of religious devotion and city defense. Other churches mentioned in various locations are the Church of St. Anne, the Church of the Martyr Zoe, and a notably improved Church of the Archangel Michael.  These detailed descriptions showcase the variety of styles and the consistent magnificence of Justinian's commissions.


## IV. The Churches of the Apostles and Other Constantinople Structures


The dedication of several churches to the Apostles is emphasized, beginning with the Churches of SS. Peter and Paul and SS. Sergius and Bacchus, which were built near the Imperial Palace.  Procopius describes the architectural similarities and subtle differences between these two churches, noting their equal magnificence.  The reconstruction of the Church of the Apostles is described as involving a cruciform plan, a significant architectural feature. The discovery of the relics of Apostles Andrew, Luke, and Timothy during this reconstruction is presented as a divine sign of approval: "In return for the respect paid them by the Emperor, the Apostles...made themselves manifest to all men."  Other churches mentioned, highlighting the extensive building program in and around Constantinople, include those dedicated to Acacius, Plato the Martyr, Mocius, Thyssus, Theodorus, Thecla, and Theodota.


## V.  Byzantium's Waterfront and Coastal Fortifications

Procopius provides a vivid description of Constantinople's strategic location and its natural harbors.  He details the Emperor's enhancements to the city's waterfront, especially the "Horn," a naturally sheltered gulf. Justinian’s construction of churches, including the Church of St. Laurentius the Martyr and the Church of SS. Priscus and Nicolaus, along the gulf exemplifies the beautification efforts. The miraculous healing of Justinian at the Church of the Martyr Irene, attributed to the discovery of the relics of forty Roman soldiers, is presented to underscore divine favor on his actions. The improvements to the churches of St. Michael, one at Anaplus and the other at Proöochthus, and the transformation of a former brothel into a women’s penitentiary highlight Justinian’s diverse efforts.


## VI. The Fortifications of Dara

Procopius shifts his focus to the military fortifications constructed by Justinian, starting with Dara on the Mesopotamian frontier.  He recounts the earlier, hastily built walls and their subsequent collapse, contrasting them with Justinian's massive improvements.  Justinian’s fortifications were designed to withstand sophisticated siege techniques anticipated from the Persians.  Procopius explains: "He placed stones which so contracted the original battlements...so that passages were left through which arrows could be shot against the assailants."  The construction of a deep, water-filled ditch and a second outer wall are detailed, demonstrating the advanced military engineering of the time. The unexpected discovery of a subterranean water source during the construction is presented as a divine intervention, which provided a unique and ingenious defense system against sieges.  The narrative underscores the strategic importance of Dara, as an "outwork of the entire Roman Empire."


## VII.  Fortifications along the Mesopotamian Frontier

The account continues with the fortifications of other Mesopotamian cities, including Amida, Rhabdium, and various other mountain forts.   The unique situation of Rhabdium, with Persian territory on either side of its Roman road, highlights the complex political landscape. Justinian’s response involved fortification:  "He enclosed Rhabdium with fortifications…and rendered it impossible for the enemy to approach it."  He also improved the defenses of numerous other forts and towns along the frontier,  demonstrating a comprehensive approach to border security.  The story of Chryses of Alexandria and his divinely inspired dream about improving Dara's water defenses, providing a dam to control flooding, highlights the combination of human ingenuity and divine intervention as factors in Justinian’s success.


## VIII. Fortifications in Armenia and Beyond

Moving to Armenia, Procopius offers a historical overview of the region before describing Justinian's reforms. He changed the system of governance, installing Roman generals and building extensive fortifications.  He emphasizes the improvements to Martyropolis, Phison, and Citharizon, outlining specific construction details like the doubling of the city walls.  Justinian's fortifications in the strategically important passes of Clisuræ, the fort at Artaleson, and the strengthened defenses of Satala are described.  The account further extends to the Tzani tribes, highlighting Justinian's pacification efforts and his construction of numerous forts, accompanied by road building to allow easier access and improved communications.   The text explains Justinian’s efforts in stabilizing these previously unruly regions.


## IX.  Fortifications in Europe: Illyricum and Greece

Procopius then turns to Justinian's extensive building projects in Europe, starting with his native region of Tauresium in Dardania. He details the construction of Justiniana Prima, emphasizing the lavishness of its buildings and its importance as a metropolitan center.  The text highlights his comprehensive approach to fortifying Illyricum,  restoring or building numerous forts to counter the threat from barbarian tribes.
