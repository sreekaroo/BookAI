# Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley: A Summary

This summary provides a chronological overview of *Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley*, highlighting key details, quotes, and observations from the text.

## Early Observations and Existing Literature

The book begins by noting the surprising lack of early mention of the Mississippi Valley's ancient monuments by initial explorers.  While brief allusions appear in the works of La Vega and De Soto's chronicler, systematic documentation begins later. The authors acknowledge the contributions of early observers like Carver, Hearte, Harris, Brackenridge, Bishop Madison, and Bartram, whose accounts, though often incomplete and sometimes exaggerated, laid the groundwork for future research.  They highlight the work of Caleb Atwater, whose 1819 memoir, while containing errors, was the first attempt at a general account of these monuments.  The authors also cite a broad range of subsequent contributors, from Lewis and Clark to prominent geologists and local researchers, emphasizing the fragmented and often speculative nature of earlier studies.  They state their intent to conduct systematic research "de novo,"  rejecting preconceived notions and relying solely on empirical observation.

## The Chillicothe Research Project

The authors detail their decision to focus their initial investigations on the Scioto and Paint Creek valleys, rich in monuments near Chillicothe, Ohio.  Plate II is presented as an example of the monument density in this region, illustrating over ten groups of large works and numerous mounds within a twelve-mile stretch.  Similar maps (Plates III and subsequent) of other valleys are included to showcase the scale and distribution of the monuments. The methodical approach of their research is stressed,  with surveys made personally by the authors and excavations conducted under their direct supervision. The authors emphasize the use of "compass, line, and rule" to ensure accuracy, contrasting their approach with previous, more casual observations. They also acknowledge the contributions of various individuals who shared their research and findings.

## Classification of Earthworks: Defences

The authors classify the enclosures, or "Forts," into two broad categories: works of defense and sacred enclosures.  The first category frequently utilizes strong natural positions, utilizing steep hills, riverbanks, and peninsulas.  The authors describe the geological features of the Mississippi Valley, noting the river terraces and the strategic use of high ground for fortifications. Plate IV depicts a stone work near Bourneville, where natural features are complemented by stone walls and gateways.  Plate V shows "Fort Hill," featuring a mile-and-a-half-long embankment and ditch, with numerous gateways.  The authors note the age of trees growing on the embankments as evidence of significant antiquity, estimating "at least one thousand years."  Plates VI-IX further illustrate various fortified hills, emphasizing the strategic use of natural features and the complex, often multi-layered, defensive systems. They note that the lowest, flood-prone terrace is consistently avoided, supporting the antiquity of the works.

## Defensive Structures: Strategies and Comparisons

The authors delve into the design aspects of defensive structures, pointing out the strategic placement of gateways and the use of earth and stone in the construction of walls.  They compare the features of the Western fortifications with those of Mexico and other cultures, noting similarities in the use of overlapping walls and guarded entrances.  Plate VII presents "Fort Ancient," a massive structure with four miles of embankment, illustrating the complexity of some of these fortifications. They discuss the probable use of palisades on top of the embankments to enhance defense and speculate about the purposes of interior mounds, possibly for observation or alarm.  The authors also explore the idea of multiple walled enclosures, demonstrating sophisticated defense strategies.  They contrast these large scale defensive works with those found in northern Ohio, suggesting the latter might be works of a distinct, more warlike people.

## Classification of Earthworks: Sacred Enclosures

The authors then address the second category of earthworks: sacred enclosures. These are typically regular in outline (square or circular) and located on level river bottoms. The absence of exterior ditches and the presence of interior ditches and mounds are presented as evidence against defensive functions.  Plates X-XV show various examples of these enclosures, many incorporating circles, squares, and octagons, often with attached mounds.  The authors note the remarkable uniformity in dimensions of some square works, suggesting the existence of standardized measurement systems among the builders. They propose that the extensive and complex works, some covering several square miles, might be linked to sun worship and other elaborate religious practices.  The authors acknowledge the scale of some of these works as a potential counterargument, however, the overall context and content of the enclosed areas strongly suggest their religious origin.

## The Significance of  Regularity and Coincidence

A recurring theme in the description of these sacred enclosures is the exceptional regularity of their forms and dimensions. The authors stress that the accurate squares and circles, some over a mile in circumference, could not have been constructed without some form of standardized measurement and angular determination.  This regularity implies a level of mathematical and engineering knowledge exceeding that of simple hunter-gatherer societies.  The authors highlight specific examples, like the High Bank Works (Plate XVI) and the Hopeton Works (Plate XVII), which exhibit near-perfect geometric forms. The coincidences in dimensions between works located miles apart are underscored as significant evidence of a shared culture and possibly a standardized construction method.

## Mound Characteristics and Excavations

The authors transition to a discussion of the mounds themselves, acknowledging previous misunderstandings of their purposes. They introduce their own four-part classification: altar mounds, mounds of sepulture, temple mounds, and anomalous mounds.  Altar mounds, found within enclosures, are characterized by stratification, symmetrical altars (of burned clay or stone), and the presence of fire-altered remains.  Detailed descriptions and diagrams (Figs. 29-47) from excavations in "Mound City" (Plate XIX) demonstrate the stratified nature of these mounds and the systematic placement of the altars.  The authors meticulously document the artifacts found within these mounds, highlighting their careful arrangement. They distinguish between the original deposits of the mound builders and subsequent burials by later Indian groups, using stratification as key evidence.

## Human Sacrifice and Burial Practices

The excavations reveal evidence of human sacrifice in altar mounds. The authors cite the presence of burned human remains on or around the altars, alongside artifacts that had been subjected to fire. The systematic stratification is viewed as evidence of ritualistic, not merely practical, construction.  They discuss the different types of burials: inhumation (simple burial), cremation (burning), and urn burial. The authors note the almost complete decomposition of the older skeletons, contrasting sharply with the better-preserved remains of later Indian burials.  The presence of objects of European origin, often found with the later burials, is highlighted to emphasize the distinction between these groups and the original mound builders.

## Temple Mounds and Anomalous Structures

Temple mounds are characterized by their size, regularity, and lack of human remains or altars.  The authors propose that these were likely platforms for structures that have since decayed. They compare these mounds to the Teocallis of Mexico. The authors illustrate several examples (Figs. 59-66) and discuss their distribution throughout the Mississippi Valley and the South.  They detail the large Cahokia mound in Illinois as a prime example. The final category, anomalous mounds, includes structures with unclear purposes, or those combining characteristics from other classifications.  One such example, an elongated mound (Fig. 67), yielded both a sepulchral chamber and an altar, suggesting a dual purpose. The authors also describe mounds seemingly made entirely of ashes and burned bones, suggesting possible cremation practices beyond those evidenced in altar mounds.  

## Animal Effigies and Other Artifacts

The book introduces the distinct category of animal effigies, prevalent in the North-west, notably Wisconsin (Plates XL-XLIV).  These giant earthworks, shaped like animals and other figures, are far less common in Ohio. Their systematic arrangement along the major Indian trails is noted, and the authors speculate on their purposes, which they suspect to be associated with rituals and possibly totems. The authors also discuss stone heaps and other less common artifact types. They emphasize the high quality of mound builder workmanship in the stone tools and ornaments, far surpassing that of later Indian groups. They then review the findings concerning metals, fossils, minerals, and shells, which provide evidence of extensive trade networks or migration patterns.  The presence of obsidian, a volcanic glass found only in distant regions, and marine shells from the Gulf are used as examples of this.

## Conclusions and Further Research

The book concludes by emphasizing the extensive scope and uniformity of the Mississippi Valley monuments, arguing against the existence of separate and distinct cultures responsible for their creation. The authors link these monuments to those found in Mexico and other parts of Central America, suggesting possible connections between the mound builders and the more advanced civilizations of the south. The authors then discuss the evidence for an agricultural society, based on the size of the monuments, their location in fertile valleys, and the nature of the artifacts found. The book then closes by considering the age of the monuments.  They present several arguments for their great antiquity, including the absence of monuments on the latest formed river terraces, the encroachment and subsequent recession of rivers, and the growth of old-growth forests over the monuments themselves. The authors conclude by stressing the need for continued research to fully understand the culture and history of the mound builders.
