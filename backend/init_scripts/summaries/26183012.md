### Preface to Volume Five

Ernest Hartley Coleridge's preface to Volume Five contextualizes the works within Byron's final two years of poetic output. He notes that the majority of these plays and poems, including *Sardanapalus*, *The Two Foscari*, *Cain*, *Heaven and Earth*, and *The Island*, have been largely neglected by readers for generations. Coleridge observes that while some of Byron's works remain known (*Cain* and *Werner*), many others have fallen into obscurity. He highlights Goethe's and Lamartine's admiration of Byron's later dramas, yet questions their accessibility to modern readers.  The preface emphasizes that despite their perceived lack of popularity, these works contain hidden treasures and passages of beauty, urging readers to approach them with an understanding of Byron's context and sources.  He reiterates his gratitude to various institutions and individuals who aided in the production of the volume.


### *Sardanapalus: A Tragedy* Introduction

The introduction to *Sardanapalus* situates the play within Byron's brief but intense engagement with regular drama, which lasted a little over a year.  It details the writing process, revealing the play's rapid composition in Ravenna between January and May 1821.  Byron's sources are discussed: Diodorus Siculus and Seneca, the latter seemingly chosen to mitigate Shakespeare's influence.  The introduction critically examines the historical basis of the play, contrasting the fictional portrayal of Sardanapalus as a "brave though voluptuous" and "amiable" character with the more martial historical record of Ashurbanipal.  The introduction also addresses the role of Myrrha, drawing parallels with Aspasia and Mirra, suggesting that her character served both to appease Byron's lover and to demonstrate the poet's capacity to portray complex female characters.


### *Sardanapalus: A Tragedy* Dedication and Preface

The play is dedicated "to the illustrious Goethe," highlighting Byron's respect for the German writer. Byron's preface emphasizes that the play was not written for the stage, referencing the public's reaction to a previous attempt at staging one of his works. He clearly states his adherence to the classical unities ("conceiving that with any very distant departure from them, there may be poetry, but can be no drama"),  acknowledging their unpopularity in contemporary English literature but defending his choice based on the established laws of earlier literature.  He also explains that he's following the account of Diodorus Siculus, while streamlining the narrative for dramatic effect.


### *Sardanapalus: A Tragedy* Synopsis of Acts I-V

The play unfolds through five acts, showcasing the contrasting aspects of Sardanapalus's personality: his effeminate indulgences and his sudden emergence as a courageous and defiant leader. Act I introduces Salemenes, the king's brother-in-law, who warns Sardanapalus of impending rebellion.  Act II reveals the conspiracy led by Arbaces and Beleses, and their attempted arrest is thwarted by Sardanapalus's unexpected clemency. Act III depicts the king's lavish banquet disrupted by the news of a full-scale rebellion, prompting Sardanapalus to unexpectedly arm himself and lead his troops to battle. Act IV portrays Sardanapalus's troubled dreams, and his discussions with Myrrha and Salemenes, showing his transition towards bravery and self-awareness. The final act sees a dramatic reversal of fortune where Sardanapalus, despite initial victories, faces ultimate defeat, choosing self-immolation with his loved ones rather than capture.  The final image is Myrrha joining him in the fiery pyre.

### *The Two Foscari: An Historical Tragedy* Introduction

This introduction sets the stage for the tragedy based on Venetian history.  It indicates Byron's reliance on Daru's and Sismondi's historical accounts of the Foscari family, despite claiming to follow a "rigidly historical" account. The synopsis summarizes the Doge Francesco Foscari's long reign and the multiple trials and exiles of his son Jacopo, highlighting the ambiguity surrounding Jacopo's guilt or innocence.  It further details the Doge's own deposition and death, brought about by the overwhelming grief of losing his son.  Byron's choice to focus on the intense emotional bond between father and son, and the son's unwavering love for Venice, is presented as an attempt to counter critical perceptions of Jacopo's character.


### *The Two Foscari: An Historical Tragedy* Synopsis of Acts I-V

Act I sets the scene in the Ducal Palace, introducing Loredano, driven by revenge, and Barbarigo, more sympathetic to the Foscaris. Act II focuses on the Doge Francesco, reflecting upon his life and the suffering of his son. Marina, Jacopo's wife, pleads with the Doge to intervene.  Act III depicts Jacopo's imprisonment and his wife's desperate attempt to see him.  The Doge's visit to his imprisoned son evokes great emotional depth. Act IV shows Loredano and Barbarigo plotting the Doge's deposition, highlighting the callous disregard for human emotion.  Act V culminates in Jacopo's death in prison.  The Doge, upon hearing of the decree for his abdication, chooses to die with dignity rather than surrender his title.  Marina confronts the conspirators with bitter recrimination even as death claims the Doge.


### *Cain: A Mystery* Introduction

The introduction to *Cain* highlights its composition in Ravenna during July–September 1821, following the completion of *Sardanapalus* and *The Two Foscari*. Byron's inspiration is traced to both the Bible and his earlier work, *Manfred*, indicating a blend of religious questioning and romantic drama.  The introduction explores the complex character of Lucifer, analyzing his resemblance to Milton's Satan and Goethe's Mephistopheles, yet acknowledging Lucifer's distinct personality. Byron's use of the Bible as a source of poetic inspiration is discussed, along with the controversy surrounding the play's alleged blasphemy and its reception among critics and the public, including Goethe's praise of its beauty and Shelley's description of it as apocalyptic.


### *Cain: A Mystery* Dedication, Preface, and Synopsis

The play is dedicated to Sir Walter Scott. Byron's preface defines the play as a "Mystery," explaining the genre and distancing his approach from the "profane productions" of earlier Mystery plays.  He defends the language of Lucifer, stating it was difficult to make him sound like a clergyman.  He further emphasizes his adherence to the language of Genesis, even in the portrayal of the Serpent, and his focus on the Old Testament with its omission of a future state.  The play follows Cain's rebellion against God, his encounter with Lucifer, his journey through space, and the fratricide of Abel. The profound impact of Cain's act leads to his exile and the curse pronounced by the Angel of the Lord. The play explores themes of free will, divine justice, the origin of evil, and human suffering within the context of religious belief and doubt.


### *Heaven and Earth: A Mystery* Introduction

The introduction to *Heaven and Earth* explains its swift composition in Ravenna in October 1821.  It is presented as a more "pious" counterpoint to the controversial *Cain*.  The delay of its publication, due to Murray's reluctance to publish a second scriptural drama, and its eventual publication in _The Liberal_, is discussed. Its relationship to Moore's _Loves of the Angels_, published shortly before, is addressed, highlighting the critical comparisons between the two works.  The introduction focuses on the play's unique source: the _Book of Enoch_, specifically the sections about the "Watchers," and notes that the "unequal union" of angels and human women is less focused on theological debate than in *Cain* and is intended to be more dramatic. The influence of Goethe's *Faust* and Æschylus’ *Eumenides* on the play's structure and style are mentioned, along with the metrical echoes of Southey’s _Curse of Kehama_.


### *Heaven and Earth: A Mystery* Synopsis

The play begins with Anah and Aholibamah invoking Samiasa and Azaziel, their angelic lovers.  Irad and Japhet, sons of Noah, appear, expressing their despair and contrasting reactions to the impending doom.  Noah and Shem arrive, confronting the fallen angels, leading to a discussion about God's judgment and the imminent deluge. Raphael, the Archangel, then enters, rebuking the angels and calling them back to Heaven.  A chorus of spirits celebrates the destruction of humanity, which Japhet counters with the promise of a Redeemer.  The play culminates in a depiction of the deluge, with mortals fleeing in terror. Anah and Aholibamah, together with their angelic lovers, depart.  Japhet, amidst universal chaos, remains, reflecting on mankind's fate and the ultimate redemption to come.


### *Werner; or, The Inheritance: A Tragedy* Introduction

This introduction details the composition of *Werner* at Pisa between December 1821 and January 20, 1822, and its unusual path to publication.  It highlights Byron's adaptation of Sophia and Harriet Lee's novel, "_Kruitzner; or, the German's Tale_," emphasizing his use of the novel's characters and plot, although he modified them and added a character (Ida).  It discusses Byron's earlier attempts to adapt the story into a play (_Ulric and Ilvina_, later lost) and explains the reasons for the novel's delayed publication, involving its transfer between publishers.  The introduction refutes claims of Byron's lack of originality, contrasting Maginn's criticisms with evidence from the novel and Byron's own manuscript to emphasize the author's modifications and inventions within the play's structure and language.  The introduction also addresses the controversy surrounding the authorship of the play,  especially the accusations made by Leveson Gower, that the play was written by the Duchess of Devonshire and later attributed to Byron.


### *Werner; or, The Inheritance: A Tragedy* Synopsis and  Authorship Debate

*Werner* follows the story of Count Siegendorf, who, living under the assumed name of Werner, is pursued by his relentless kinsman, Stralenheim, who covets his inheritance. The plot unfolds through dramatic encounters and conflicts:  Siegendorf is robbed in his lodgings, triggering suspicions that involve his mysterious son, Ulric. Act II explores the robbery, while Act III reveals Siegendorf's hiding of Gabor, an accused thief.  Act IV further intensifies the dramatic tension with a meeting between Siegendorf, Ulric, and Gabor, leading to a revelation of Ulric's involvement in Stralenheim's death. Act V centers around the confrontation, which shows the deep-seated conflict between father and son and the eventual collapse of the family's fortunes.

The introduction also critically examines the debate around the play’s authorship.  While Leveson Gower argues that the play was written by Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, evidence provided in the introduction—including Byron's own notes, correspondence, and contemporary accounts—strongly suggests Byron's authorship. The introduction points out inconsistencies in Gower's arguments and uses internal and external evidence, such as parallels between *Werner* and Byron's other works, and accounts from those who witnessed Byron's writing process, to support the case for Byron’s authorship.


### *The Deformed Transformed: A Drama* Introduction

The introduction to *The Deformed Transformed* explains its composition in Pisa around 1822, likely between the deaths of Allegra and Shelley. It notes the play's origin in the forgotten novel, "_The Three Brothers_," and its connection to Goethe's *Faust*.  The introduction connects the play's themes, particularly the protagonist's desire for physical transformation, to Byron's own experiences with his clubfoot and the resulting self-consciousness and social stigma he experienced.  It emphasizes the play's exploration of the relationship between personality and individuality, combining metaphysical considerations with historical elements. It addresses Medwin's account of Byron's burning of an earlier version of the poem due to criticisms of a similar work by Shelley, and the false accusation of plagiarism. The introduction then analyzes the play's indebtedness to _The Three Brothers_ and Goethe's *Faust*, highlighting the similarities and differences between the characters and storylines.  The play's depiction of the Sack of Rome in 1527 is also discussed, along with the relevant historical context and Byron's research of the event.


### *The Deformed Transformed: A Drama* Advertisement and Synopsis

The advertisement acknowledges the sources of the drama: "_The Three Brothers_" and Goethe's *Faust*.  The play consists of three parts, of which only the first two and a chorus from the third were published.  The story centers on Arnold, a hunchback, who makes a pact with a mysterious stranger, a type of devil figure, to transform his physical form.  Part I takes place in a forest. Arnold contemplates suicide due to his deformity and his mother's rejection, but is interrupted by the Stranger. The Stranger offers him a choice of forms, culminating in the transformation of Arnold into Achilles.  Part II is set during the Sack of Rome.  Arnold, now transformed, participates in the assault on the city, highlighting his changed appearance and the continued presence and influence of the Stranger. This part explores themes of violence, religious conflict, and the destruction of beauty. The brief fragment from the third part suggests a continuation of the theme of power and its corrupting influence.  The play showcases Byron's exploration of themes of appearance versus reality, the nature of good and evil, the corrupting nature of power, and the psychological consequences of physical deformity and social rejection.



### *The Island; or, Christian and His Comrades* Introduction

The introduction to _The Island_ details its composition in Genoa around January-February 1823.  Byron's stated sources are Bligh's _Narrative of the Mutiny on the Bounty_ and Mariner's _Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands_.  The introduction explains how Byron used Bligh's account as a structural framework for a narrative set in the fictional island setting inspired by Mariner's descriptions of the Tonga Islands.  The introduction notes that Byron’s knowledge of the mutiny and its aftermath is limited to Bligh's _Narrative_, and that he does not address later events, such as the settlement on Pitcairn Island.  Importantly, Byron's portrayal of Bligh as a heroic and wronged figure, and his relatively uncritical adoption of Bligh's perspective, is noted and contrasted with more nuanced modern interpretations of the mutiny which often sympathize with Christian and the mutineers.  The introduction concludes with an assessment of _The Island's_ poetic merit, comparing its strength and coherence to Byron's earlier works, noting the poem's weaker structure but acknowledging passages of exceptional beauty and wit.


### *The Island; or, Christian and His Comrades* Synopsis of Cantos I-IV

Canto I recounts the mutiny of the _Bounty_ from Bligh's perspective.  Canto II focuses on the mutineers' arrival at Toobonai (Tubuai),  featuring a description of their interaction with the island's inhabitants, their peaceful life, and the relationship between Neuha and Torquil.  The events unfold into Canto III, where a clash ensues between the mutineers and Bligh's loyalists.  Christian's defiant last stand, leading to his death, is vividly portrayed.  Canto IV continues with the mutineers' escape and their desperate flight across the ocean.  Neuha and Torquil find refuge in a hidden cave.  The final scene depicts their return to their island home, where their story becomes part of local folklore.  The poem blends historical events with romanticized depictions of the island setting and the characters' relationships, showcasing Byron's skill in vivid descriptions of nature and human emotions within an exotic setting.
