# The Renaissance: Studies in Art and Poetry - A Chronological Summary

## A Medieval Renaissance in France (12th-13th Centuries)

Walter Pater begins by challenging traditional views of the Renaissance, arguing that it wasn't solely a 15th-century revival of classical antiquity but a broader movement.  He points to a "Renaissance within the middle ages," starting in the late 12th and early 13th centuries in France, marked by a growing appreciation for physical beauty, earthly passion, and intellectual freedom.  He uses Abelard and Heloise as prime examples, highlighting their passionate relationship and Abelard's writings, which sought to ground philosophical abstractions in human experience.  Pater notes Abelard's absence from Dante's *Divine Comedy*, suggesting Dante's inability to judge Abelard's place within "eternal justice," a characteristic of the Renaissance's independent spirit. Two illustrative examples of this early French renaissance are the stories of *Li Amitiez de Ami et Amile* and *Aucassin and Nicolette*.

## The Friendship of Amis and Amile: A Medieval Strength

The story of *Amis and Amile* showcases the medieval Renaissance's strength through a tale of unwavering loyalty and self-sacrifice.  The extraordinary similarity between the two friends, symbolized by their identical cups given by the Pope, emphasizes their deep bond.  Amis's affliction with leprosy and Amile's willingness to kill his own children to cure his friend highlight the extreme lengths of their commitment.  The miraculous survival of the children underscores the intertwining of the earthly and divine in the narrative:  “For, as God had united them in their lives in one accord, so they were not divided in their death, falling together side by side…And the bishop ordained many clerks to serve in the church of Saint Oseige, and commanded them that they should guard duly, with great devotion, the bodies of the two companions, Amis and Amile.”  This showcases the potent blend of secular loyalty and religious miracle characteristic of the period.

## Aucassin and Nicolette: Medieval Sweetness

*Aucassin and Nicolette*, in contrast, exemplifies the Renaissance's "languid excess of sweetness". The story, possibly of Arabian origin, features a love story set against a backdrop of idyllic scenery and delicate sensuality.  Nicolette, a beautiful and mysterious Saracen girl, embodies this sweetness.  Her escape from imprisonment, described with exquisite detail, highlights the languid, almost wanton aesthetic: "Her hair was yellow in small curls, her smiling eyes blue-green, her face clear and feat, the little lips very red, the teeth small and white; and the daisies which she crushed in passing…the girl was so white!"  Aucassin’s defiance of Hell for love underscores the antinomian spirit of the time – rejecting traditional religious constraints in favor of passionate earthly desires.

## Pico della Mirandola: Reconciling Christianity and Paganism

Pater introduces Pico della Mirandola as a key figure in the 15th-century attempt to reconcile Christianity with classical paganism.  While lacking a modern historical sense, Pico's allegorical interpretations of both Plato and biblical texts reveal the age's desire to find harmony between seemingly disparate belief systems.  His famous oration on the dignity of man, with its anthropocentric view of the universe ("nodus et vinculum mundi, the bond or copula of the world, and the 'interpreter of nature'"), reflects the Renaissance's growing humanism.  However, Pater notes the ultimately unsustainable nature of Pico's allegorical approach, contrasting it with the more successful artistic fusion of pagan and Christian themes.

## Pico's Life and Works: A Fusion of Pagan and Christian

Pico's life mirrors his intellectual project.  His youthful intellectual wanderings, his ambitious attempt to defend nine hundred paradoxes, and his eventual return to a simpler faith demonstrate the Renaissance's experimental spirit. His works, like the *Heptaplus*, attempted to reconcile Plato and Moses through allegorical interpretations, showcasing the period's fascination with hidden meanings and symbolic correspondences.  His later piety, coupled with his continued interest in pagan mythology, encapsulates the complex blend of influences at the heart of the Renaissance: “It is not hard to know God, provided one will not force oneself to define Him… Love God…And yet had men liefer by knowledge never find that which they seek, than by love possess that thing, which also without love were in vain found.”


## Sandro Botticelli: Poetical Painter of Melancholy

Pater shifts focus to Sandro Botticelli, a "poetical painter" who blended narrative and sentiment with visual elements. His illustrations for Dante's *Divine Comedy* showcase his ability to translate literary imagery into visual form, though Pater notes the limitations of translating Dante’s intense imagery into visual art.  Botticelli’s unique style, characterized by a "wistfulness of exiles" and "ineffable melancholy," is analyzed through his Madonnas, which express a poignant longing for earthly warmth that contrasts with the conventional religious iconography.  This melancholy, a key characteristic of his work, even permeates his classical paintings, such as his *Venus Rising from the Sea*:  “The light is indeed cold--mere sunless dawn; but a later painter would have cloyed you with sunshine; and you can see the better for that quietness in the morning air each long promontory, as it slopes down to the water's edge.”

## Luca della Robbia: Expressiveness in Humble Materials

Pater highlights Luca della Robbia's unique contribution to 15th-century sculpture. While his initial work was in marble, he innovated by applying his sculptural principles to earthenware, producing the iconic pale blue and white pottery.  His low-relief sculptures, in contrast to the high relief of Michelangelo, aimed to capture subtle expressions of life and emotion: "The whole essence of their work is EXPRESSION, the passing of a smile over the face of a child, the ripple of the air on a still day over the curtain of a window ajar."  His work embodies the Florentine spirit of combining artistic excellence with everyday life, a departure from the religious exclusivity often seen in art of previous eras.

## Michelangelo's Poetry: Strength and Sweetness

Pater examines Michelangelo’s poetry, focusing on the interplay of "strength" and "sweetness" within it.  Michelangelo’s art, characterized by a powerful yet restrained intensity, finds a parallel in his poems. The author notes the importance of  Signor Cesare Guasti's work in establishing a more accurate version of Michelangelo's poems, correcting errors and omissions in earlier editions. Although often perceived as solely expressions of distress over Vittoria Colonna, Pater argues that the sonnets represent a broader, life-long effort to reconcile his intense emotions with ideal sentiment, often drawing upon Platonic ideals rather than Dante’s style of love poetry.

## Leonardo da Vinci: Curiosity and the Desire for Beauty

Leonardo da Vinci is presented as a figure of enigmatic genius, characterized by his relentless curiosity and desire for beauty. His restless personality, marked by sudden shifts in focus and unfinished projects, is reflected in his life and art. Pater discusses his early training under Verrocchio, emphasizing the young Leonardo's surpassing of his master in the *Baptism of Christ*.  Leonardo’s intense focus on nature, evident in his notebooks filled with scientific observations, is analyzed, highlighting his unique approach to art which aimed to capture the "finest and most delicate effects of painting":  "Nature was 'the true mistress of higher intelligences.'"  The *Medusa* and the *Last Supper* are discussed as examples of Leonardo's unparalleled mastery, showcasing his ability to blend scientific precision with artistic innovation.


## The School of Giorgione: Aspiration Towards Music

Pater analyzes the Venetian school of painting, particularly Giorgione’s work, emphasizing its unique understanding of pictorial qualities.  He argues against simplistic views that reduce art to mere translations of literary or other themes, emphasizing the inherent sensuousness and musicality of painting. Giorgione, though his authentic works are fewer than previously believed, becomes a symbol of Venetian art's pursuit of perfection through the precise selection of subjects and the masterful blending of form and matter in his paintings.  The "Concert" in the Pitti Palace, one of Giorgione's few undoubtedly authentic works, is used as the model for the characteristics of his "school"  –  the emphasis on music, fleeting moments of beauty, and the skillful interweaving of human figures and landscape.  This culminates in the assertion that Giorgione, in his refined and suggestive style, embodies the ideal aspiration of all art toward the condition of music.


## Winckelmann: Rediscovering the Hellenic Ideal

The final essay focuses on Johann Joachim Winckelmann, whose writings revolutionized the study of art. Pater details Winckelmann's journey from a difficult childhood and an unfulfilling academic career in Germany to a life devoted to studying and interpreting classical antiquity in Italy.  He highlights Winckelmann's conversion to Catholicism as a strategic move to access resources and opportunities in Rome, a pragmatic act within a framework of intensely focused artistic pursuit.  Pater analyzes Winckelmann's deep affection for the Hellenic ideal, evident in his writings and his friendships with young men, noting that he "made himself a pagan" to understand antiquity.  The essay concludes by situating Winckelmann within a broader historical context, emphasizing his contribution to the enduring Hellenic tradition and the influence of his passionate devotion to the classical ideal, a passion that ultimately led to his tragic death.

## Conclusion: The Ephemeral and the Exquisite

Pater concludes by emphasizing the ephemeral nature of all experience, both physical and mental.  Life is a constant flux of impressions and sensations, always vanishing as we attempt to grasp them.  He advocates for a life devoted to embracing the full spectrum of these experiences –  "To burn always with this hard, gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life."  He urges rejection of limiting orthodoxies and a constant pursuit of new impressions and opinions.  Art, particularly its most passionate and beautiful forms, becomes a means of intensifying and extending this transient experience, offering an "exquisite passion" for the sake of the moment.  His final words reiterate the importance of a life intensely lived, "gathering all we are into one desperate effort to see and touch".
