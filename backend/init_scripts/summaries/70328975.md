# Cathedrals of Spain: A Summary

## A Unique Architectural Tapestry: Salamanca

Salamanca uniquely showcases Spain's architectural evolution.  Two cathedrals stand side-by-side, embodying contrasting styles: the older, a "rude... monument of early virile effort," and the newer, a "ponderous self-assurance." The older cathedral, begun around 1100 under Bishop Jeronimo Visquio, blends Burgundian Romanesque with Byzantine and Oriental influences.  Its capitals are described as "among the great glories of the edifice... comparable to the best of Saint Mark's or of Sancta Sofia," showcasing intricate carvings of "beasts and monsters, real and mythical animals, masks and contorted human figures and devils."  The pointed Gothic vaulting, a later addition, contrasts with the Romanesque dome and lantern, the "Torre del Gallo," a "magnificently interposed members of the drum,"  praised for its "lofty aspiration."  The newer cathedral, begun in 1513, reflects the grandeur of Imperial Spain, a blend of Gothic and Renaissance styles, showing "display and sculptural fireworks" but ultimately lacking the earlier style's structural logic.  The kings' letter initiating the project highlights the inadequacy of the old cathedral: "The Cathedral Church of the said city is very small, dark, and low."


## The Cid's Legacy and Burgos' Cathedral

Burgos, the birthplace of the Cid Campeador, boasts a cathedral equally legendary.  Begun around 1221, under Saint Ferdinand and Bishop Maurice, the structure showcases a blend of French Gothic, Cistercian austerity, German intricacy, and Spanish exuberance.  The original plan, as reconstructed by Señor Lamperez y Romea, displayed remarkable symmetry.   However, later additions and alterations, including the collapse and rebuilding of the crossing in 1539, resulted in a more complex but picturesque structure. The lantern over the crossing, erected after the collapse, is described by Théophile Gautier as "a group of sculpture, d'arabesques, de statues, de colonettes… to give you vertigo… gigantic as a pyramid and delicate as a woman's earring." The Chapel of the Constable, with its Plateresque style and the recumbent figures of the Constable and his wife, exemplifies the lavish, yet somewhat chaotic, spirit of the later additions. The spires, quintessentially German in character, added later, are described as rising above the city "like the jeweled points of a monarch's crown."


## Avila's Fortified Sanctuary

Avila's Cathedral of San Salvador, integrated into the city's medieval walls, stands as a symbol of the Church Militant.  Begun in 1091, it's a unique blend of Romanesque and Gothic styles, with its apse forming part of the city's fortifications.  The apse's "fighting turret," with its "black, weather-stained granite,"  is described as "inaccessible, grim, and warlike," a fitting representation of the era's fusion of religious and military roles.  The interior, while smaller than other great Spanish cathedrals, is characterized by its strong, early Gothic work and the striking use of light and shadow.  The main entrance is described as "distressingly out of place," a stark contrast to the original austere Romanesque style. Longfellow's poem, referenced in the text, captures the cathedral’s spiritual and historical significance. 


## Light and Color in León's Cathedral

León's Cathedral, a masterpiece of late thirteenth-century French Gothic, is renowned for its lightness and color. The text emphasizes the plan's "almost perfect symmetry" and the extensive use of stained glass, creating a "joyousness" within the building. The author describes the glass as "emerald, turquoise, and peacock, amber, straw, scarlet, and crimson," a "continuous series of divine rainbows." The intricate design of the rose windows are directly compared to the western wheel of Notre Dame de Paris. The author notes the daring construction, a "culmination of the daring of Spanish Gothic," which resulted in later repairs and modifications.  Despite these changes, the church maintains its remarkable luminosity, and the stained glass remains a breathtaking element.


## Toledo's Imperial Grandeur

Toledo's Cathedral, begun in 1227, represents nearly six hundred years of architectural evolution,  combining early Gothic with later styles. The author describes the relationship between the cathedral and the city's civic life, noting its use for "festivals, meetings, thanksgivings, for surging, excited crowds." The plan, likened to Bourges but far more ambitious, is praised for its "logical and lucid" arrangement.  The text highlights the contrast between the impressive interior and the "insignificant and unworthy" exterior, a consequence of centuries of additions and alterations.  The author notes the placement of the choir in the center of the nave as a unique feature of Spanish churches, interrupting the perspective.  The extraordinary ironwork of the choir screen and the lavishly carved choir stalls are cited as some of the finest examples of Spanish craftsmanship, with the latter being described as "perfected and better designed than anything found elsewhere."


## Segovia's Last Gothic Blaze

Segovia's Cathedral, begun in 1522 after the destruction of its predecessor during the Comunidades revolt, stands as a testament to the tenacious adherence to Gothic style in a time when Renaissance was gaining dominance.   The author emphasizes the architect Juan Gil de Hontañon's loyalty to Gothic design, noting the cathedral’s striking resemblance to his work in Salamanca, yet praising its superior quality and harmonious semicircular apse.  The completion of the cathedral, with its magnificent dome and elaborate vaulting, is hailed as the "last great monument in Spain" of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture.  The text documents the extraordinary relocation of the older cloister to the new building, a feat of architectural engineering.


## Seville's Majestic Immensity

Seville's Cathedral, the largest Gothic cathedral in the world, is an overwhelming testament to scale and the fusion of various architectural styles.  The author describes the conflicting opinions of various architectural historians regarding the cathedral's stylistic identity, highlighting its unique blend of Gothic, Moorish, Renaissance, and Baroque elements.  The author emphasizes the cathedral's overwhelming scale, contrasting its imposing size to other major European cathedrals and describing the structure as "a mountain scooped out, a valley turned topsy-turvy.” The magnificent ironwork of the choir screens, the vast retablo, and the impressive stained glass windows (by Aleman,  among others) are praised as exceptionally impressive examples of medieval craftsmanship.   The placement of the choir in the nave is again highlighted as a distinctive Spanish feature.


## Granada's Blend of Faith and Conquest

Granada's Cathedral, begun in 1523 on the site of a former mosque, marks a transition from Gothic to Renaissance styles. The text describes the city's unique history, its conquest by Ferdinand and Isabella in 1492, and the subsequent expulsion of the Moors. The Cathedral itself is less impressive than its Royal Chapel, a masterpiece of Plateresque architecture.  The author highlights the Chapel's remarkable iron screen, "the most stupendous and magnificent ever executed," its exquisite craftsmanship, and the tombs of Ferdinand and Isabella, noting the detail in these portraits of the monarchs. The text underscores the blend of styles, with Gothic elements persisting in the chapel's vaulting despite the overall Renaissance style.


## The Giralda: Seville's Moorish Jewel

The Giralda, Seville's iconic tower, is described as the "greatest of all the monuments of that enlightened civilization," a potent symbol of Moorish ingenuity and strength.  The author recounts its transformation from a minaret to a Christian bell tower, noting the addition of the Renaissance top and Girardello as later additions to the original Moorish structure.  Its remarkable brickwork and intricate arabesque patterns are described as uniquely Moorish, contrasting with the heavy classical elements in the Christian additions.  Dumas' evocative description,  "It is marvelous to see this golden figure, with its wings spread," is included to showcase the feelings of wonder inspired by the structure. The description emphasizes its inherent strength and unique character, distinct from both other Moorish towers and European counterparts.


## Conclusion:  A Legacy in Stone

The book concludes by reinforcing the significance of Spain's cathedrals as living testaments to its complex history and artistic heritage.  It underscores the intertwining of architectural styles, religious fervor, political struggles, and the influence of diverse cultural forces on shaping these magnificent edifices.  The final paragraphs emphasize the contrasting experiences of the cathedrals: the grandeur and often chaotic nature of the structures,  their  intertwined histories, and the simultaneous beauty and decay visible throughout Spain's cities. The final emphasis is on the enduring legacy of the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella, and their lasting impact on the nation's identity.
