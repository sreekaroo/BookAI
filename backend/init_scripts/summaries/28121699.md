# A Tribute to Michael Hart: The Genesis of Project Gutenberg

This document is a tribute to Michael Hart, the founder of Project Gutenberg, written by Majid AlHydar. The text details Hart's life, his motivations, and the creation and development of this groundbreaking digital library.  The Arabic text is translated and summarized below.


## The Passing of a Digital Saint

The tribute begins by highlighting the quiet passing of Michael Hart, contrasting it with the media frenzy surrounding the death of Steve Jobs.  AlHydar emphasizes Hart's relatively unknown contribution to humanity: the invention of the eBook and the establishment of Project Gutenberg.  The author immediately establishes Hart's significance, placing him alongside major inventors and innovators. The opening line, "ورحل مايكل هارت.. قدّيس الكتاب الرقمي!" (Michael Hart passed away… the saint of the digital book!), sets a reverent tone for the biography that follows.


## Early Life and Education

Michael Hart was born in Washington D.C. in 1947 to parents who worked in military code-breaking during World War II.  The family later moved to Illinois, where both parents became university professors. Hart himself initially studied chemical engineering at the University of Illinois, but left after two years.  He served in the military during the Vietnam War, then returned to academia, earning a degree in humanities with distinction in just two years. While he didn't complete postgraduate studies, this period provided the crucial opportunity for his life's work.


## The Spark: Access to a University Computer

In 1971, Hart gained unprecedented access to the University of Illinois' computer system, a privilege afforded only to a few researchers at the time. This access was provided by the university's computer center and a friend of Hart’s brother, enabling him to use one of fifteen networked computers. This seemingly minor event, in a network that would eventually evolve into the internet, would be the genesis of Project Gutenberg. The early usage of these massive, yet primitive by today's standards, computers focused mainly on data processing.  Hart’s visionary approach was to utilize them for information dissemination.


## The Declaration of Independence: A Momentous Inspiration

AlHydar recounts a pivotal anecdote, comparing it to Newton's apple: While returning home from a Fourth of July fireworks display, Hart bought groceries and received a copy of the Declaration of Independence. Instead of discarding it, he decided to use his university computer access to digitize and distribute the document.  This simple act was far from trivial due to the lack of operating systems and user-friendly software available at the time.  The process of converting text to digital form was arduous, highlighting the technological limitations of the era.  The initial attempt to email the document to multiple recipients was rejected due to server limitations, a hurdle that inspired his groundbreaking idea.


## The Vision: A Free Digital Library

This rejection sparked Hart's visionary idea of a free, online library: to digitize thousands, even millions, of books and make them accessible to anyone with internet access.  He set the ambitious, and at the time, seemingly impossible goal of making the ten thousand most important books available by 2000.   The challenge included choosing books in the public domain to avoid copyright infringement, a process that began with works like the Bible, Homer's epics, Mark Twain, and Shakespeare.


## Early Growth and Challenges

By 1987, despite sixteen years of effort, Hart had only digitized 313 books.  However, this year marked a significant turning point.  He joined a group of university personal computer users and, with the assistance of programmer Mark Zinzow, began recruiting volunteers worldwide. The establishment of mirror sites and mailing lists revolutionized the project's growth. This collaborative approach led to a rapid expansion, bringing the number of digitized books to over 38,000, with an average of fifty new books added each week.


## Project Gutenberg: A Fitting Name

The choice of the name "Project Gutenberg" is deliberate.  It references Johannes Gutenberg's invention of the movable type printing press in 1447, a technological leap that revolutionized book production. Hart's digital library, therefore, inherited the legacy of making books accessible to a wider audience.  The project's stated mission, as described by Hart, is to "encourage the creation and distribution of electronic books, help break down the barriers of illiteracy, and provide the greatest number of e-books to the greatest number of people."


## The Project's Evolution and Functionality

In the early years, Hart manually digitized each book until the advent of the scanner in 1989. Since 1981, however, he relied on a team of over twenty thousand volunteers for tasks such as site management, scanning, proofreading, translation, and formatting. Hart focused on oversight, development, and fundraising.  The library offered its materials in various formats like plain text, PDF, and HTML, ensuring accessibility.  While initially concentrated on Western literature, the collection expanded to include diverse fields like art, music, philosophy, science, and even non-textual material like musical scores and audio files.  The project emphasizes neutrality and objectivity, allowing global volunteers to contribute and curate their selection of books.


## Legal and Quality Control

Project Gutenberg, while fighting legal battles to expand the public domain, adhered to US copyright laws. Materials were added only after legal confirmation of expired copyrights or author consent.  The project, being non-profit, didn't claim new copyrights, encouraging free reproduction and distribution.  Addressing criticisms concerning accuracy, the project continuously incorporates corrections and suggestions, striving for a balance between the original text and accessible digital formatting.  The initiative to create and distribute CDs and DVDs containing various collections starting in 2003, eventually reaching over 30,000 books in 2010, further demonstrated their commitment to free and wide access.


## Michael Hart: The Man Behind the Vision

The tribute describes Hart as a unique individual, characterized by his deep belief in his work, coupled with humility and a rejection of commercial success.  He described himself as "not a CEO," preferring to focus on his contributions.  He lived simply, supplementing his income with odd jobs and repairing his own belongings. His dedication to Project Gutenberg overshadowed personal comforts, even affecting his health and ultimately, leading to his early death. He lived frugally, content with second hand items, simple meals, and even home remedies for ailments.  He famously attributed his success to "being in the right place at the right time."


## Legacy and Inspiration

The tribute concludes by emphasizing Hart's enduring impact.  Initially ridiculed, Hart's vision has become a reality, with millions of digital publications flourishing across the internet.  The author compares Hart to Don Quixote, fighting against the seemingly impossible, and highlights his unwavering determination and compassion. The tribute celebrates Hart's creation as not just a technological accomplishment but also a testament to human perseverance and the power of collective collaboration.  His legacy continues to inspire future generations, serving as a reminder of the transformative power of technology and the importance of making knowledge freely accessible.  Hart's work is a testament to the profound impact a single individual can have on the world, especially when combined with a team of committed volunteers, leaving a mark on humanity through accessible knowledge for all.
