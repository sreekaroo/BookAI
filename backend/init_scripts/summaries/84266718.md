# Colonial Homes in North Carolina: A Summary

This summary condenses the provided text, "Colonial Homes in North Carolina," into chronological paragraphs exceeding 10% of the original text length.

**1. Aerial Perspective: Mapping Colonial North Carolina**

The book initiates with an aerial perspective, employing historical maps to visualize colonial North Carolina.  It highlights William P. Cumming's _The Southeast in Early Maps_ as a crucial resource.  The authors discuss details from Eman Bowen's 1747 map, noting its depiction of the "Charokee Mountains," the intricate eastern coastline with settlements like Edenton, Bath Town, and New Bern, and the westward expansion reflected in the map's limitations.  A detail from Henry Mouzon Jr.'s 1775 map provides a closer look, showcasing the Albemarle Sound region with its towns, roads, farms (identified by owner names like "Morris" and "Evans"), and the Great Dismal Swamp. This section emphasizes the use of standardized symbols on maps for churches and courthouses, providing insight into the spatial organization of colonial settlements.

**2. Delving into Town Plans: Sauthier's Surveys**

The focus shifts to Claude Joseph Sauthier's meticulous town plans, commissioned by Governor Tryon between 1768 and 1770.  Using the Hillsboro map as an example, the authors delve into the details, interpreting Sauthier's conventions like the use of heavy lines to indicate building mass and shaded areas for gardens.  The map's strategic importance (made after the Regulator uprising) and the symbolic placement of the church ("A, Church"), courthouse ("B, Court House"), jail ("C, jail," spelled "goal"), and market house ("D, Market House") are discussed.  The analysis highlights how the map reflects the town's layout, roads connecting to other settlements, and the presence of mills ("E, Mills").  The authors contrast the planned rectangular grid of Hillsboro with the organic, medieval design of Grenoble (from Mumford's _The Culture of Cities_), emphasizing the "modern" aspects of colonial town planning.

**3. A Detailed Visit: The Palmer-Marsh House in Bath**

The narrative then transitions to a detailed examination of the Palmer-Marsh house in Bath. A conjectural sketch, based on Sauthier's 1769 map of Bath, illustrates the house's location on Water Street, its outbuildings (well house, smoke house, dairy, barn), gardens, and orchard, showcasing a self-sufficient farmstead model. The authors compare before-and-after photographs of the house, highlighting the 19th-century additions (porches and classical details) and the recent restoration efforts to recapture its original 18th-century appearance.  A plan of the house reveals the unique double chimney, central hall, and original partition, noting the discrepancies between the Sauthier map and actual measurements.

**4. Architectural Styles: Log Houses and Their Variations**

The discussion next addresses various types of colonial construction.  Starting with log houses, the text presents images and descriptions illustrating different log joining techniques, from simple notched joints to more elaborate dovetail and saddle joints.  The Britten Sanders log cabin in Southern Pines and the Blair-McCormack house near High Point serve as examples of both simple and more sophisticated log construction, showcasing the skill of colonial craftsmen.  The authors also introduce the "Saddle-Bag" and "Dog-Run" cabin plans (also known as "Possum Trot"), highlighting their functional design for families. Frederick Law Olmsted's observations from _A Journey in the Slave States, 1856_, are quoted to provide context on the variations in log cabin quality.

**5. Framed Houses: Medieval Traditions in Colonial America**

The text proceeds to discuss framed houses, linking them to medieval European building traditions.  Illustrations from Forman's _Architecture in the Old South_ depict various framed house types, including half-timbered constructions. The Brothers House in Salem is highlighted as a rare surviving example of open-timber construction, discussing the restoration process that involved removing 19th-century clapboards. This section also delves into the structure of the Palmer house during its restoration, revealing the use of vertical studs and horizontal laths in a surprisingly modern-looking wooden frame, contrasting it with more traditional, medieval techniques. Mortise and tenon joints are explained, emphasizing the craftsmanship involved.

**6. Brick and Stone Structures: Material Choices and Techniques**

The next section examines brick and stone houses.  The Jordan farm house near Windsor, potentially built in 1713, exemplifies the use of Flemish bond brickwork, with its distinctive light and dark checkerboard pattern.  The authors note the placement of chimneys within the walls, creating a seamless exterior.  The Newbold-White house near Hertford displays different brickwork details.  The text delves into several bricklaying techniques, illustrating Flemish bond, English bond, diagonal brickwork, and curved brick patterns.  The Old Brick House near Elizabeth City is presented as an example of a structure combining brick chimneys with wooden walls, discussing the use of ballast stones in the foundation.  The Michael Braun house near Salisbury represents a late colonial stone house with notable architectural features.

**7. Roof Designs: Gable, Gambrel, and Hipped**

The authors then discuss roof designs: gable, gambrel, and hipped.  A diagram compares gable and gambrel roofs, noting their construction complexity and the impact on attic space.  The hipped roof is described, highlighting its design impact on the visual appearance of the house and the use of this style in public buildings. The authors mention the common "story-and-a-half" design of colonial houses, suggesting its connection to tax laws.


**8. Understanding Floor Plans: A Spatial Exploration**

The focus shifts to the understanding and interpretation of floor plans. Simple diagrams of one-room, two-room, and three-room (Quaker) plans are presented.  The evolution of the center hall plan is traced, comparing a primitive version (Newbold-White house) to a more developed design.  A four-room plan (Old Brick House) is analyzed, highlighting its asymmetrical features and the placement of fireplaces and chimneys.  The side hall plan is briefly introduced. The text emphasizes how understanding a floor plan enhances appreciation for a building's design and function.

**9. Lean-Tos and Porches: The Southern House Plan**

The concept of the "Southern house" is introduced, focusing on the addition of lean-tos and large porches to basic rectangular houses.  Diagrams illustrate the expansion of a simple rectangular house with the inclusion of a lean-to and a front porch, emphasizing the improved functionality and aesthetic appeal of this design.  Variations in this plan are shown, featuring gambrel roofs, two-story central blocks, and multiple-tiered porches.  The Hummock house in Beaufort and the Sloop Point house (MacMillan house) near Wilmington serve as examples of this style, with detailed discussion of their construction features, including foundations, porches, and chimneys. The text also notes the influence of West Indies architecture on porch design.  The evolution of the Sloop Point house is traced through before-and-after diagrams, highlighting additions and modifications over time.


**10.  Later Colonial Architecture and Beyond: Tryon Palace and Preservation**

The final section briefly touches upon the characteristics of late colonial architecture, contrasting it with the earlier style.  Tryon Palace in New Bern is used as a prime example, highlighting its three-part layout (kitchen, palace, stables), the use of classical pediments, and the emphasis on symmetry and order, reflecting a shift towards more formal and "modern" designs.  The authors conclude with an appeal to readers to actively participate in preserving old buildings by undertaking their own architectural research, offering suggestions for research methods, and recommending various resources available in North Carolina (libraries, archives, historical societies).
