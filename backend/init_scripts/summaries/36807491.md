# Five Years' Explorations at Thebes: A Summary

##  Initial Excavations and the Tomb of Teta-ky (1907-1908)

Lord Carnarvon initiated systematic excavations in the Theban necropolis in 1907, focusing on three sites: a location near a village mosque, the Birâbi, and a section of the Eleventh Dynasty cemetery.  The first site, explored in 1908, yielded a significant discovery: the tomb of Teta-ky, a "King's Son," dating from the early Eighteenth Dynasty. This tomb, primarily a mud-brick structure with subterranean sepulchers, revealed an early portrait of Queen Aahmes-nefert-ari, depicted as "of fair complexion and not black," adoring the goddess Hathor. The tomb also contained numerous wooden funerary figures, some crudely carved and others elaborately painted and gilded, placed in unique positions—four niches in the courtyard wall and around the top of the main shaft—possibly as guardians.  Carnarvon notes the importance of careful excavation to minimize theft, employing a rule that "no clearing of a chamber or pit was carried on unless Mr. Carter or I was present."

## Birâbi Discoveries: Tablets and Early Tombs (1908-1909)

Further excavations in the Birâbi, in 1908, uncovered a XVIIth Dynasty tomb (No. 9) containing two significant wooden tablets covered in stucco and inscribed with hieratic texts.  These tablets proved to be of immense historical value. One tablet featured a "contemporary record of the conflict of the Theban Dynasty with the Hyksos," detailing events from the seventh year of King Kamosi's reign.  The other contained a copy of part of the Proverbs of Ptah-hetep.  The text described Kamosi's northern campaign to drive back the Hyksos, stating,  "I have gone north victorious to drive back the Asiatics by the command of Ammon: the plans of my army have succeeded." The discovery of these tablets highlighted the importance of even seemingly minor sites within the densely populated necropolis.


##  Uncovering Hatshepsut's Valley Temple (1909-1910)

Continuing the Birâbi excavations in 1909, a well-built stone wall was discovered, initially assumed to be post-Eleventh Dynasty. Further clearance revealed it was part of a terrace temple, eventually identified as a "Valley-Temple" or "Portal" to Hatshepsut's Dêr el Bahari temple. Inscriptions on blocks of the wall included the name of Hatshepsut's master-builder, Pu-am-ra, conclusively dating the structure to her reign. This discovery, Carnarvon observes, was a "surprise ... in such a well-known place." A foundation deposit containing objects bearing Hatshepsut's name and the name of her temple (_Zeser-zeseru_) confirmed the temple's association with Hatshepsut's complex. This deposit contained an "alabaster pebble elaborately inscribed" with details of Hatshepsut's work at the Dêr el Bahari temple. 

##  Middle Kingdom Tombs Beneath the Valley Temple (1910)

Beneath the Valley Temple's foundations, excavations revealed a series of pit and corridor tombs dating from the late Middle Kingdom and the Intermediate Period.  These tombs had been thoroughly plundered multiple times; firstly, soon after the Middle Kingdom's end, and then again during Hatshepsut's reign. Carnarvon mentions finding “fragments of one stela were found in two separate tombs,” demonstrating the thoroughness of the earlier robberies.  Retaining walls, built to support the shafts dug by later robbers, gave insight into the multiple phases of looting.

##  Amenemhat IV and Tomb No. 25 (1910)

One of the pit tombs, Tomb No. 25, proved particularly rich. Although initially appearing plundered, it yielded an unopened coffin with scattered objects of the original burial.  Crucially, a fine ivory, ebony, and cedar wood casket bore the cartouche of Amenemhat IV, precisely dating the tomb to his reign.  The casket, meticulously restored by Carter from hundreds of pieces, bore the name of "the ‘Keeper of the department of Food’, Kemen." The inscription also invoked the god Sebek, Lord of [Illustration: hieroglyph] _[H.]ent_, linking the burial to a Fayûm locality significant to the later Twelfth Dynasty kings. Other objects found included a gaming board, a mirror, and a necklace, further enriching the understanding of the XIIth Dynasty funerary practices.

##  The Intermediate Period and Tomb No. 37 (1910-1911)

Further excavations revealed that many of the Middle Kingdom tombs had been re-used during the Intermediate Period.  This was further demonstrated by the discovery of Tomb No. 37 in 1911, containing sixty-four coffins and numerous artifacts spanning from the Intermediate Period to the reign of Thothmes III.  One chamber was sealed with impressions of Thothmes I, while objects found included scarabs from the Thirteenth Dynasty and Hyksos period, as well as those from the reigns of Amenhetep I, Thothmes I, II, III, and Hatshepsut.  "The contents of this tomb thus cover the whole of the Intermediate period to the beginning of the reign of Thothmes III," notes Carnarvon.

##  Ptolemaic Vaulted Graves (1910-1911)

Above the Middle Kingdom tombs, numerous Ptolemaic vaulted graves built of mud bricks were found. These graves, initially possibly above ground, had been completely plundered, leaving behind only fragmented remains of the burials. However, the substructures revealed evidence of amphorae, buried beneath the floors and often sealed, containing grain, water, and cakes.  The discovery of two demotic papyri and a hoard of Ptolemaic coins within these sealed vessels decisively dated the graves to the early Ptolemaic period.

##  Rameses IV's Colonnade and Other Finds (1911)

Below the Ptolemaic graves, paving slabs marked with circles indicating column positions were found, revealing the remains of a colonnade running east-west. A foundation deposit beneath the colonnade contained objects bearing the name of Rameses IV, definitively identifying him as the builder. The deposit, "placed in the sand and enclosed by a few bricks," consisted of various electrum and faience objects.

##  Late Middle Kingdom and Intermediate Period Necropolis: Further Details (1911)

Systematic exploration of the rock-hewn tombs below the Valley Temple in 1911 uncovered a vast number of artifacts.  The tombs were all plundered, sometimes multiple times.  The team meticulously cataloged the remains, which included varied coffin types (decorated and plain rectangular, dug-out, _Rishi_, anthropoid), funerary furniture, amulets, jewelry, tools, and pottery.  These finds helped to refine the understanding of funerary practices during these periods. Tomb No. 37, in particular, yielded "a total of sixty-four coffins," including seven distinct types of adult coffins and many children's coffins. The artifacts within this tomb included wooden statuettes, scarabs, necklaces, musical instruments and even a working bird trap. 

##  Conclusion:  Systematic Excavation and its Rewards

The five years of excavation, marked by meticulous record-keeping and careful excavation techniques, provided extensive data on the Theban necropolis, extending from the early Eighteenth Dynasty to the Ptolemaic period.  Carnarvon's emphasis on systematization and detailed recording stood in contrast to earlier, less systematic efforts.  The project uncovered not only high-profile tombs but also a wealth of information about less prominent individuals and the evolution of funerary practices over centuries.  Important discoveries included tablets relating to the expulsion of the Hyksos, an early portrait of Queen Aahmes-nefert-ari, and the remains of Hatshepsut’s Valley Temple. The detailed cataloging of the objects from tomb No. 37 is presented as an exemplar of the project’s thorough methodology.  The discoveries underscore the continuing potential for archaeological research in this well-known but far from exhausted site.
