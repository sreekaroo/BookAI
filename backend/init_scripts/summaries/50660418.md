This summary breaks down the provided text into chronological paragraphs, detailing the book's content.

## 1. Preface: A Foundation of Scholarship

The book begins with a preface by J.W. Mollett, outlining its origins as a revised and expanded edition of a French dictionary by Ernest Bosc.

He acknowledges his reliance on numerous authorities for specific areas, including:  *Martigny* for Christian antiquities, *Meyrick’s Ancient Armour* for medieval armour, *Planché* and *Fairholt* for costume, *Boutell* and *Mrs. Bury Palliser* for heraldry, and *M. Jacquemart* for pottery.  He notes the reduction of Greek and Roman antiquities, directing readers to more specialized dictionaries for deeper engagement with those subjects. Mollett also highlights the inclusion of Indian, Chinese, and Japanese terms, guided by *Dr. Birdwood’s Handbooks*,  and concludes by referencing *Mr. Fairholt’s Dictionary of Art Terms* as a crucial comparative resource.
