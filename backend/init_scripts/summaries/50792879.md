## The Dance of Death: A Detailed Chronological Summary

**1. The Earliest Edition and Its Creators:**

The provided text begins by detailing the earliest known edition of "Holbein's Dance of Death," published in Lyon in 1538. The original French title, "_Les Simulachres & Historiées Faces de la Mort avtant elegamtment pourtraictes, que artificiellement imaginées_," translates to "The Images and Storied Aspects of Death, as elegantly delineated as [they are] ingeniously imagined."  The book is a small quarto, featuring a nondescript emblem with the legend "Vsus me Genuit" and the phrase "Gnothe seauton" on an open book. It was printed by Melchior and Gaspar Trechsel, brothers of German origin established in Lyon. The preface, addressed to the Abbess of Saint Pierre les Nonnains, is attributed to Jean de Vauzelles, hinting at authorship through the phrase "_Salut d'un vray Zèle_" which mirrors the family motto "_D'un vray Zelle_." The text itself consists of forty-one woodcuts, each accompanied by a Latin biblical quote and a French quatrain penned by Gilles Corrozet.  Appendices and a discourse "_De la Necessite de la Mort qui ne laisse riens estre pardurable_" ("On the Necessity of Death, which leaves nothing enduring") complete the volume.  Subsequent editions, with minor additions, followed until 1562.


**2. Predating the Publication: The Artist's Hand (Holbein):**

Despite the 1538 publication date, evidence suggests the woodcuts were designed and carved much earlier, around 1524-1525.  The text cites engraver's proofs from various museums,  dating before the book's publication. Crucially, enlarged Indian ink drawings in the Berlin Museum, believed to be sketches for glass painting, are dated 1527 and clearly copied (not reversed) from the woodcuts, confirming the earlier creation date.  These sketches’ presence further supports the theory that Hans Holbein the Younger, resident in Basel until 1526, was the designer.  The text argues that Holbein's prior work on an "Alphabet of Death" and the existence of a famous Basel Dance of Death mural would have influenced him.  Finally, the style of the woodcuts is deemed definitively Holbein's.


**3. The Mysterious Woodcutter (Lutzelburger):**

While Holbein's authorship of the designs is established, the woodcutter's identity remains elusive.  Jean de Vauzelles' preface mentions "_la mort de celluy, qui nous en a icy imaginé si elegantes figures_" ("the death of him who imagined for us these elegant figures here"), confirming the woodcutter's death before 1538.  The monogram "HL" found on one woodcut ("The Duchess") is attributed to Hans Lutzelburger (Hans of Luxemburg), a "form-cutter" ("formschneider").  This attribution is based on his signature on other works, including Holbein's "Little Dance of Death."  Further evidence suggests that a "formschneider" named Hans, who had dealings with the Trechsels, died in Basel before June 1526, supporting the theory of Lutzelburger's identity but lacking conclusive proof. The delay between the creation of the woodcuts (around 1526) and their publication (1538) and the withholding of Holbein's name in the preface are attributed to the potentially satirical and controversial nature of the designs.


**4.  Later Reproductions and Their Limitations:**

Numerous reproductions of "The Dance of Death" followed the original 1538 edition. The text mentions copies from Venice (1545), Augsburg (1554), and a popular English version by John Bewick (1789). Etchings by Hollar (1651) and Deuchar (1788), as well as lithographic reproductions by Schlotthauer (1832) and others, are documented.  The text highlights that various methods were employed - etching, lithography, photolithography – but emphasizes that these methods could not perfectly replicate the unique qualities of Lutzelburger's original woodcut technique using a knife, versus the graver used by later artists.


**5. The Present Edition's Distinction:**

The specific edition described uses woodcuts engraved in 1833 for Douce's edition of Holbein's work.  The author asserts that, despite the inherent limitations of copying woodcuts with a graver, this edition offers a superior reproduction compared to etched or lithographed versions.  The key advantage is that the 1833 reproductions attempted to use the same medium - wood - although acknowledging the unavoidable differences from Lutzelburger's original skill.


**6. A Chant Royal Inspired by Holbein's Work:**

The text then includes a Chant Royal poem, credited to Austin Dobson and dated 1877, inspired by the themes and imagery of Holbein's "Dance of Death."  The poem underscores the inevitability and universality of death,  affecting all classes and social standings, from "Princes and potentates" to the "tired Ploughman."  The poem emphasizes death's lack of pity and its dominion over all aspects of life, echoing the woodcut series's message.  The poem's title, "_Contra vim Mortis non est medicamen in hortis_," ("Against the violence of death there is no remedy in gardens"), further highlights this inescapable fate.


**7. Detailed List of the Woodcut Illustrations:**

A comprehensive list of illustrations follows the poem, providing both the English and German titles for each of the 41 woodcuts in the 1538 edition, and several more added in later editions. The captions provide concise descriptions of each scene, depicting death's intrusion into the lives of various figures representing different societal ranks and professions. Examples include "The Pope," "The Emperor," "The King," "The Cardinal," and "The Queen," as well as figures of lesser social standing such as "The Ploughman," "The Pedlar," and "The Beggar."


**8. Sample Woodcut Captions and Verses:**

The text then presents several of the woodcuts with their accompanying biblical quotations (in Latin) and French quatrains. The first four examples illustrate the biblical narrative, starting with creation and proceeding to the Fall, expulsion from Eden, and the toil brought about by humanity's disobedience. For instance, Plate II, "The Temptation," features the quote  "Quia audisti vocem vxoris tuæ, & comedisti de ligno ex quo preceperam tibi ne comederes, &c. (Genesis iii.)" and the verse "ADAM fut par EVE deceu / Et contre DIEV mangea la pomme, / Dont tous deux ont la Mort receu, / Et depuis fut mortel tout homme."  These samples display the book's didactic aim, relating biblical events to the all-encompassing power of death.

**9.  Continuation of Woodcut Samples and Their Interpretations:**

Subsequent examples show death's impact on various social classes and individuals.  For example, Plate VI ("The Pope") illustrates death's reach even to the highest religious authority. Plate VIII ("The King") emphasizes that even royalty cannot escape death.  The accompanying verses reinforce the moral message of mortality, as in Plate XX, "The Counsellor," with the quote "Qui obturat aurem suam ad clamorem pauperis, & ipse clamabit, & non exaudietur (Prover. xxi.)" and the verse "Les riches conseillez tousiours, / Et aux pauures clouez l'oreille. / Vous crierez aux derniers iours, / Mais Dieu uous fera la pareille."(You counsel the rich always, / And close your ear to the poor.  You will cry out in the last days, / But God will do the same to you). The overall tone suggests a criticism of social injustice and a warning about the consequences of worldly pursuits.


**10.  Concluding Remarks and Publication Details:**

The final pages of the provided excerpt show remaining samples of the woodcuts, their corresponding quotes and verses. The last plate, "The Escutcheon of Death," includes an emblem that is relevant to the designer and his wife. The text concludes with a note on the edition's production, specifically mentioning that 750 copies were printed on Japan vellum for the Scott-Thaw Company in July 1903.  The entire excerpt thus carefully documents the history, artistry, and symbolism of Holbein's "Dance of Death," emphasizing the collaboration of artist, woodcutter, and writers, as well as the various interpretations and reproductions that have perpetuated its enduring legacy.
