# Archaeology and the Bible: A Chronological Summary

## The Dawn of Civilization in Egypt (Pre-Dynastic to Old Kingdom)

The book begins by describing the unique geography of Egypt, shaped by the Nile's inundation.  This predictable flooding, coupled with the lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures, contributed to the remarkable preservation of ancient artifacts. Archaeological exploration, spurred by Napoleon's invasion and the discovery of the Rosetta Stone (allowing decipherment of hieroglyphs), revealed a civilization stretching back millennia. Manetho's dynastic lists, supported by artifacts like the Palermo Stone and king lists, provided a framework for chronology, with the Sothic cycle offering further refinement. The pre-dynastic period (circa 5000-3400 BCE) saw the gradual unification of 42 nomes into two kingdoms, Upper and Lower Egypt, each with distinct symbols and crowns. The archaic period (circa 3400-2980 BCE) witnessed the unification under Menes and the development of hieroglyphic writing.  The Old Kingdom (circa 2980-2475 BCE), marked by the supreme power of the Pharaoh, saw the construction of the magnificent pyramids of Giza and the Sphinx, showcasing remarkable architectural and engineering skills.  The book notes the emergence of a powerful nobility towards the end of the Old Kingdom, foreshadowing the coming instability.


## The Middle Kingdom and First Intermediate Period (Egypt)

The First Intermediate Period (circa 2475-2160 BCE) saw Egypt fragment into warring kingdoms, a cycle reflecting its early political structure.  The Middle Kingdom (circa 2160-1788 BCE), starting with the Theban Eleventh Dynasty, witnessed a renewed unification under powerful pharaohs of the Twelfth Dynasty.  These rulers expanded Egypt's influence into Nubia, and fostered trade with Palestine and Syria, as depicted in tomb paintings that hinted at connections to the story of Joseph. Sesostris III's military campaigns into Palestine are highlighted. The period also produced significant literature reflecting a developing social conscience, including texts like "The Eloquent Peasant" and "The Admonitions of Ipuwer," which demonstrate parallels to certain prophetic themes in the Old Testament.


## The Second Intermediate Period and the New Kingdom (Egypt)

The Middle Kingdom's decline led to a second period of disintegration (circa 1788-1580 BCE), culminating in the invasion of the Hyksos, foreign rulers who introduced Semitic influences into Egypt.  The book discusses the debate surrounding the Hyksos' origins and the presence of Semitic place names in the Delta during this time.  The New Kingdom (circa 1580-1070 BCE), beginning with the expulsion of the Hyksos by Amosis I, established a vast empire under powerful pharaohs like Thutmose III.  Their conquests across the Near East created significant interaction with other cultures.  The Amarna letters, discovered at Tell el-Amarna, provide a wealth of information regarding the political landscape and interactions between Egypt and Palestinian cities around 1350 BCE.  Amenophis IV's attempts at monotheism and the construction of his new capital at Akhetaten are discussed,  followed by the rise of the Nineteenth Dynasty, with Ramses II and the potential connection to the oppression of the Israelites.  The Merneptah Stele, with its mention of Israel, is considered a pivotal discovery for understanding the Exodus period.


## Exploration of Bible Lands: Early Discoveries and the Palestine Exploration Fund

The book then shifts focus to the broader exploration of Bible lands, starting with early travelers and their observations.  The systematic exploration of Egypt by Napoleon's expedition is mentioned, leading to the decipherment of hieroglyphs thanks to the Rosetta Stone. The exploration of Mesopotamia began in the early 19th century with figures like Claude James Rich documenting ruins and inscriptions. Subsequent expeditions by Botta, Place, and Layard at Nineveh and Khorsabad revealed the palaces and artifacts of Assyrian kings.   The Palestine Exploration Fund's work, beginning in 1865, was instrumental in mapping Palestine and conducting excavations, starting with Warren's explorations of Jerusalem's Temple Mount, revealing its ancient foundations. The systematic survey of Palestine and later excavations at various sites like Lachish and Gezer are detailed, illustrating the Fund's critical contribution to understanding the country's history.


## Excavations in Palestine: Cities, Walls, and Domestic Life

Detailed accounts of Palestinian excavations are given, highlighting the work of Bliss and Macalister in the Shephelah, and Macalister's comprehensive excavation at Gezer.  The stratified layers of Gezer revealed successive occupations, from pre-Semitic cave-dwellers to the Israelite period and beyond. The book describes the city's walls, including the massive Amorite wall and later additions, showcasing the evolution of defensive architecture.  Features of Palestinian houses, including materials, construction techniques, and domestic tools, are described, based mainly on Macalister's Gezer findings, along with comparisons to similar finds at Jericho, Megiddo, and Samaria.  The presence of foundation sacrifices, often involving child sacrifices, provides insights into religious practices.  The design and significance of city gates, vital for defense and social interaction, are also explored.


## Palestinian Water Systems and Agriculture

The importance of water sources for city location is noted, with details on various water systems, such as underground tunnels (like the one at Gezer) and reservoirs (like Solomon's Pools). The chapter on agriculture highlights the reliance on rainfall and the development of farming techniques, including tools (hoes, plows, sickles) and methods for threshing, winnowing, and grinding. The discovery of granaries with different types of grain provides material evidence for the agricultural products mentioned in the Bible. The book describes olive presses and wine vats, emphasizing the prevalence of olive and grape cultivation. The agricultural calendar, uncovered at Gezer, illustrates the importance of these crops to the daily lives of the people.  Details on domestic animals, including cows, horses, sheep, goats, and asses, and surprisingly the evidence of beekeeping, are also provided.  The presence of hens is noted only in later periods, indicating their introduction after the Biblical period.


## High Places and Temples in Palestine

The book discusses evidence of religious practices in Palestine, starting with pre-Semitic cave-dweller sanctuaries, featuring sacrifices of pigs.  Various high places, like those at Tell es-Safi and Gezer, are detailed, with descriptions of their layout, including "pillars" (monoliths) and evidence of child sacrifice.  These high places are contrasted with more formal temples, such as the ones at Megiddo and Samaria, exhibiting parallels to Canaanite and Israelite religious practices. The book notes the presence of a possible Philistine temple at Gezer, and a structure in Megiddo possibly linked to Samson's destruction of the Dagon temple.  The temple to Augustus at Samaria, reflecting Greco-Roman influence, is highlighted as a contrast to the earlier, more simple structures.


## Palestinian Burial Practices and the Story of Jerusalem

The book next examines burial practices in Palestine.  The varied types of tombs, from cave burials with offerings to shaft tombs, and doorway tombs, many rock-hewn, illustrate ancient traditions. The distinctive tomb with a rolling stone, paralleled by the tomb of Jesus, is considered. The story of Jerusalem is then developed chronologically, using archaeological findings to trace the city's development. Starting with pre-Israelite cave dwellers near Gihon, and evidence for an early city in the El-Amarna period, the book follows the growth and changes under the Jebusites, David, and Solomon.   Solomon's building projects are discussed, with special attention given to the Temple and Palace complex and its location on the eastern hill.


## Jerusalem from Solomon to the Roman Period

The account of Jerusalem continues, tracking its development through different periods and highlighting key events. The book notes the damage to the walls during conflicts and subsequent repairs under different rulers.  Hezekiah's construction of the Siloam tunnel, along with the Siloam inscription, illustrating both his efforts and the engineering skills of the time. The destruction of the city in 586 BCE and the subsequent rebuilding of the second Temple are detailed. Nehemiah's work in rebuilding the city walls is considered and its layout is reconstructed based on biblical accounts and archaeological findings. The city's development under the Asmonæans and Herod the Great, including the construction of Herod's palace, temple, and other structures, is examined. The book concludes with discussions of the locations of the Pool of Bethesda, Gethsemane, and Calvary.  The building of the third wall under Herod Agrippa I is also discussed, noting the difficulties in tracing its exact course.


## The Decapolis and the Churches of Asia Minor

The book then turns to the Decapolis, a region east of the Jordan, highlighting its ten major cities, some of which were originally Palestinian settlements.  The book describes their Greco-Roman architecture, drawing parallels between this Hellenistic cultural influence and the context of Jesus' ministry in the region.  Finally, it examines the sites of several significant churches in Asia Minor—Ephesus, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Smyrna, and Laodicea—linking archaeological discoveries to the letters in Revelation and Paul’s missionary activities. The exploration and excavation of these cities reveal their evolution from earlier settlements to major centers of Roman administration and subsequently, early Christianity. The book connects specific locations with Paul’s activities, and compares the architecture of the Roman and early Christian structures, and comments on the significance of the letters in Revelation.


## Ancient Texts Illuminating the Bible: Creation, Flood, and Patriarchs

Part II of the book focuses on translating and interpreting ancient Near Eastern texts that offer parallels to or illuminate the biblical narrative.  It begins with a translation of the Babylonian creation epic, comparing it to Genesis 1, highlighting both the similarities (e.g., the concept of primeval chaos, creation in seven days/tablets) and significant differences (polytheistic vs. monotheistic outlook).  Another Babylonian creation account is compared with Genesis 2. The Babylonian Sabbath is then considered, noting its differences from the Hebrew Sabbath.  The Adapa myth is presented as a parallel to the story of the fall of man in Genesis 3, highlighting the shared themes of knowledge, immortality, and punishment but emphasizing the contrasting theological perspectives.  The book then explores Babylonian lists of long-lived kings, comparing them to the genealogies in Genesis 4 and 5, showing a possible link between the names in the Babylonian king lists and those of the patriarchs.


## Ancient Texts: Exodus, Hammurabi's Code, and the Patriarchs

A Babylonian flood narrative from Nineveh is translated and compared with the Genesis flood story, noting both similarities and differences in theological perspective.  Another creation and flood account from Nippur is presented, showing a different version of events and emphasizing the diversity of ancient traditions.  A text describing the origin of a city and the development of agriculture from Nippur is then translated and compared with Biblical material regarding agriculture and the origins of settled life. The chapter on Abraham analyzes Babylonian contracts involving an individual named Abamrama (Abraham), providing evidence that "Abraham" was a common name in Babylonia during this time, but emphasizing that the Babylonian Abraham was not the Biblical patriarch.  The book highlights evidence of travel and trade between Babylonia and Palestine during the Patriarchal age.  Discussions of the possible identification of Hammurabi and Kudur-Mabug with figures in Genesis 14 follow.  Finally, texts related to Jacob and Joseph are discussed, highlighting occurrences of the names in Egyptian and Babylonian records. The book explores the Tale of Two Brothers as a parallel to the story of Joseph and considers various letters addressing a ruler like Joseph, illustrating the possibility of similar power structures in ancient Egypt.


##  Ancient Texts:  Israelite History, Psalms, Proverbs, and Jesus

The book continues by examining texts relating to the period of the Israelite Judges and Kings.  The report of Wenamon is translated, illustrating conditions in Palestine and Phoenicia around 1100 BCE.  The Merneptah Stele, containing the earliest extra-Biblical mention of Israel, is examined.  The Moabite Stone, bearing the inscription of Mesha, King of Moab, is translated and compared to biblical accounts.  Assyrian inscriptions detailing their interaction with the Israelites, particularly Tiglath-pileser IV, Shalmaneser V, and Sargon, and Sennacherib, are translated and used to confirm and illuminate events described in the books of Kings and Isaiah.  The Siloam Inscription, connected with Hezekiah's water system, illustrates that king's accomplishments.  The inscriptions of Nabuna'id and the capture of Babylon are discussed in relation to the book of Daniel.  The inscription of Cyrus, permitting the return from exile, is examined.

Then, Babylonian and Egyptian psalms and hymns are analyzed, demonstrating a range of religious sentiments and demonstrating both similarities and profound differences to the Hebrew psalms.  Babylonian and Egyptian proverbs are translated and compared to the book of Proverbs.  A passage from the Gilgamesh epic is compared to Ecclesiastes.  Finally, passages from Assyrian and Egyptian texts providing parallels to passages in the Prophets' writings are examined, and several early sayings of Jesus found in Egypt are presented.
