# The Business of Being a Housewife: A Summary

## The Meat of the Matter: Understanding Meat Prices

The book begins by addressing a common housewife concern: the seemingly high price of meat. It clarifies that comparing the cost of a live animal to the price of a single, desirable cut (like tenderloin) is misleading.  The author explains that only about 55% of a steer is meat, with the rest comprising by-products of varying value.  This means the cost of the animal must be carried by the meat portion, making a seemingly high markup per pound of steak justifiable.  The retailer faces further challenges; some cuts sell at a loss, requiring higher prices on desirable cuts to compensate.  The author stresses the importance of considering the *aggregate* price of all parts of the carcass to understand the retailer's true profit margin: "Only the aggregate price which the retailer gets for all parts and portions of the carcass will show his margin over the initial cost. It is wholly improper, therefore, to compare sixty-cent steaks with twelve-cent cattle with a view to determining profit."

## The Housewife's Economic Role

The book positions home management as a crucial national business, emphasizing the economic power of American housewives.  With "twenty million home managers," their purchasing decisions significantly impact the entire food industry. This second edition is dedicated to those "wise home managers who are determined to understand more fully their relation to the producers of the country and to the great industries, such as that of Armour and Company, who have made possible the providing of perfect food in perfect condition at any distance from the farm."

## Shifting Economic Landscapes and Food Production

The text notes significant changes in food production, with low food prices unlikely to return.  The previous reliance on readily available government land and minimal costs has been replaced by expensive land and intensive farming methods: "Formerly much of the food was raised by numerous individual families on Government land at nominal cost; today practically all food is raised on expensive land—the plains have been turned into villages and farms by the increasing population."  This necessitates modern food preservation techniques such as cold storage, refrigerated transport, and canning to minimize waste and maintain supply.  The book highlights Armour & Company's role in this evolution.

## Armour & Company's Role in the Food Chain

Armour & Company is presented as a vital link between farmers and consumers.  They are involved in all aspects of the process, from advising farmers on better farming practices and animal husbandry to employing expert raw material buyers, specialists in food preparation, and managers to efficiently deliver safe and quality meat to consumers: "Through our agricultural department we reach out to the farmer and advise him in producing the best meat animals and farm products within his farm’s possibilities. We assist him to improve his soil and to feed his animals to the best advantage."

## The Importance of Brand Recognition and Smart Purchasing

The authors strongly advocate for purchasing known brands, emphasizing label reading as a crucial buying tool.  They urge consumers to prioritize U.S. Government inspected meats and canned goods from reputable companies. This, they argue, eliminates guesswork and expensive food experiments:  "Expensive experimenting with foods may be eliminated from your accounts by the simple method of buying by known brands. Label reading is today’s most important buying guide."

## Understanding Food Values and Nutritional Needs

The book stresses the crucial importance of understanding food values in planning family meals. It highlights the pervasive problem of undernourishment, even among affluent families.  Home managers are encouraged to use prepared foods to free up time for learning about nutrition and planning balanced meals to ensure family health and efficiency:  "This is one of the most serious matters before us today, and the physicians of the entire country are deploring the fact that many of the children of the wealthy as well as of the poor are undernourished."

## Budgeting and Financial Planning

A simple budgeting system is presented as essential for successful home management.  The authors suggest tracking expenses for four months, then creating a four-month budget based on the data, followed by a yearly budget after further analysis. The goal is to identify non-essentials, and strategically invest in areas of growth.  Sample budget percentages are provided as guidelines for families of various sizes and income levels, but emphasize flexibility to accommodate personal needs and ambitions: "The food section of the Family Account Book is perhaps the most important. Without properly prepared food in proper combination, and quantity, we are not able to exercise our greatest earning ability, to grasp new situations as we should, or to invest our savings wisely."

## Selecting High-Quality Protein Foods: Meat and Alternatives

The book focuses on meat as a primary protein source, discussing various cuts of beef, veal, pork, and lamb. Detailed charts provide information on the water, protein, fat, ash, carbohydrates, and calorie content of different cuts.  The importance of U.S. Government meat inspection is emphasized, and the book explains the four inspections each animal undergoes to ensure wholesomeness. This section highlights that even less expensive cuts are equally nutritious, emphasizing the need for housewives to utilize a broader range of cuts to avoid driving up prices on more popular choices: "Nine out of ten home managers have believed for years, as do some even now, that the more expensive and most tender cuts of meat must naturally be most nutritious and that the cheaper, long fibered cuts are to be discarded or left for the butcher to dispose of, not realizing that their purchase of the tender cuts only, forces prices of these cuts high enough to cover the cost of the carcass."

## The Importance of Cold Storage and Food Preservation

Cold storage is presented as a critical solution for managing food supply throughout the year. The book explains the processes involved and dispels misconceptions regarding its safety, emphasizing the importance of reputable cold storage facilities.  This section covers the storage of various foods, including meat, butter, eggs, and poultry, and provides guidelines for thawing frozen poultry: "The establishment of scientific refrigeration plants has made possible a variety and abundance of food at any season on the American table."

## Meat Cookery Techniques and Recipes

The book delves into meat cookery methods, distinguishing between short cooking methods for tender cuts and longer, moist cooking methods for less tender cuts. It provides detailed instructions for broiling, pan broiling, roasting, baking, pot roasting, boiling, braising, sautéing, stewing, and deep frying.  Several recipes for various meat dishes are included, emphasizing flavor combinations and maximizing the use of all parts of the animal.  The book also covers poultry cookery, providing instructions for roasting, stewing, broiling, and frying.

## Expanding the Culinary Repertoire:  Beyond Meat

This section explores meat substitutes and alternatives, focusing on eggs, cheese, peanut butter, and beans. It explains the nutritional value of each, emphasizing the importance of combining them with other food groups for balanced nutrition.  The book also includes a range of recipes utilizing these ingredients, showcasing their versatility in creating hearty and satisfying meals.

##  Household Management and Efficiency Tips

The final sections offer practical advice on household management, including suggestions for creating a well-stocked pantry, meal planning, and creating menus for various occasions. It also covers basic table service and hostessing tips, emphasizing preparedness and efficiency. The text concludes by reiterating the importance of understanding food values, choosing high-quality ingredients, and minimizing food waste to ensure both economic and nutritional well-being.
